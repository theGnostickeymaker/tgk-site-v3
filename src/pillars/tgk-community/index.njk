    <p>
      <strong>TGK Community</strong> is the gathering space of The Gnostic Key â€”
      a place for seekers to meet, share, and reflect together. Here dialogue,
      study circles, and live sessions carry the work beyond the scrolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than a forum, this is a living circle â€” a commons of remembrance where
      voices join, questions unfold, and collective gnosis takes root.
    </p>
