    <h1 class="scroll-heading">The TGK Community Charter</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      This Charter establishes the cultural foundations of the TGK Community. It sets the expectations, the discipline,
      and the shared ethic that guides all discussion within this space. Membership in the community signifies agreement
      to uphold these principles.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section-block">
    <h2 class="section-heading">I. Purpose of the Community</h2>
    <p>
      The TGK Community exists to cultivate clarity, inquiry, and intellectual courage. It is a gathering place for
      individuals who value truth above spectacle and insight above hostility. The purpose is not to win arguments but
      to deepen understanding through disciplined dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a sovereign space. It is not governed by the whims of commercial platforms, nor shaped by the prevailing
      culture of outrage. It is a deliberate environment in which thought is taken seriously.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section-block">
    <h2 class="section-heading">II. The Steel Man Principle</h2>
    <p>
      The Steel Man Principle is the defining feature of this community. Every member is required to demonstrate
      comprehension before offering critique.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">A. The Requirement</h3>
    <p>
      Every reply must begin with a brief summary of the position being addressed. This summary must be written in your
      own words and must represent the argument in its strongest reasonable form.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">B. Examples</h3>
    <p><strong>Acceptable:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      My understanding of your argument is that you believe institutional decline has accelerated because trust has been
      replaced with compliance. I agree with some of this, although I see a different cause for the change.
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Unacceptable:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      So you are saying the system is perfect and nothing is wrong. That makes no sense.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Posts that do not meet this requirement may be returned for clarification or withheld from the thread until the
      representation is corrected.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section-block">
    <h2 class="section-heading">III. Conduct and Culture</h2>

    <h3 class="subheading">A. Respect as a Baseline</h3>
    <p>
      Respect is not a performance but a discipline. Members are expected to address ideas without diminishing the
      dignity of the individuals proposing them.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">B. No Personal Attacks</h3>
    <p>
      Critique arguments, systems, and public power. Private individuals are not subjects of investigation here.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">C. No Hostility or Provocation</h3>
    <p>
      Insults, mockery, baiting, and other forms of provocation undermine the purpose of this space and will be removed.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">D. Pseudonymity</h3>
    <p>
      Members may use pseudonyms. Real names are neither required nor encouraged. Your ideas are your identity within
      this forum.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section-block">
    <h2 class="section-heading">IV. Boundaries and Safeguards</h2>

    <h3 class="subheading">A. Prohibited Content</h3>

      <li>No calls for violence</li>
      <li>No doxxing or sharing of private information</li>
      <li>No threats or intimidation</li>
      <li>No bigotry or dehumanisation</li>

    </ul>

    <h3 class="subheading">B. Technical Requirements</h3>
    <p>
      Commenting requires email sign-in. Members are responsible for securing their own accounts.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">C. Moderation Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      Moderation exists to preserve clarity, dignity, and safety. It is applied sparingly and with transparent reasoning.
      Decisions focus on behaviour, not belief.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section-block">
    <h2 class="section-heading">V. The Ethic of Inquiry</h2>
    <p>
      This community values curiosity over certainty. Members are encouraged to ask questions, challenge assumptions,
      and explore unfamiliar perspectives. Rigour is expected, but dogmatism is not.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of dialogue here is not to score points but to trace the shape of truth together.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section-block">
    <h2 class="section-heading">VI. Membership and Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      Membership in the TGK Community carries responsibility. Each person contributes to the culture and atmosphere of
      the space. Good faith is expected. When conflict arises, members should seek clarification before escalation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section-block">
    <h2 class="section-heading">VII. Commitment</h2>
