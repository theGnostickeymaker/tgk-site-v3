        The Steel Man method requires you to express the argument you are addressing in its
        strongest reasonable form. This practice safeguards fairness, reduces misunderstanding, 
        and elevates discussion quality.

    <section class="section-block">
      <h2 class="section-heading">What a Steel Man Is</h2>
      <p>
        A Steel Man summary is a clear and strengthened restatement of another argument. 
        It reflects what a reasonable advocate might say, even if the original point was expressed
        imperfectly.

      <p><strong>Ineffective representation:</strong>  
        “You think we should stop caring about any of this.”

      <p><strong>Steel Man:</strong>  
        “Your position is that emotional overwhelm weakens effective resistance, and that 
        cultivating resilience allows for clearer action against injustice.”
