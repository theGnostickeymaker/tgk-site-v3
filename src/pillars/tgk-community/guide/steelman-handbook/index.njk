      <p class="lead">
        The Steel Man principle is the intellectual anchor of the TGK Community.  
        It ensures that disagreement is grounded in understanding rather than assumption.

      <h2 class="section-heading">I. What a Steel Man Is</h2>
      <p>
        A Steel Man is the strongest reasonable interpretation of the speaker’s actual argument.  
        It is not a caricature, not a straw man in reverse, and not an exaggerated version invented 
        to sound impressive. It is a disciplined representation of what is genuinely being said.
      </p>

    <!-- SECTION II -->
    <section class="section-block">
      <h2 class="section-heading">II. Practical Examples</h2>
      <p>
        Future sections will include demonstrated examples of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Good vs poor Steel Man attempts</li>
        <li>How to summarise ambiguous or emotionally charged posts</li>
        <li>How to Steel Man arguments you strongly disagree with</li>
        <li>How to extract the core claim from long or unfocused writing</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION III -->
    <section class="section-block">
      <h2 class="section-heading">III. Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Without the Steel Man discipline, conversations descend into projection, misreading, 
        and cycles of correction.  
        With it, clarity becomes the default and disagreement becomes productive.
