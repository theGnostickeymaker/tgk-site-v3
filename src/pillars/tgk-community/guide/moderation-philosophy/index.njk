      <h1 class="section-heading">Moderation Philosophy</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Moderation within the TGK Community is protective, not punitive.  
        It safeguards clarity, dignity, and the shared ethic that makes this environment possible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION I -->
    <section class="section-block">
      <h2 class="section-heading">I. Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Moderation exists to maintain the integrity of discourse.  
        Its aim is not to enforce ideology but to protect behaviour that supports the 
        Charter’s principles and the community’s intellectual atmosphere.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION II -->
    <section class="section-block">
      <h2 class="section-heading">II. Boundaries</h2>
      <p>
        Intervention occurs when conduct undermines clarity, safety, or the shared sense 
        of good faith. This includes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hostility or provocation</li>
        <li>Baiting or manipulation</li>
        <li>Doxxing or privacy breaches</li>
        <li>Mistreatment of other participants</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION III -->
    <section class="section-block">
      <h2 class="section-heading">III. Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Moderation decisions are applied with clear reasoning and without spectacle.  
        Members may request clarification if a decision affects their participation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION IV -->
    <section class="section-block">
      <h2 class="section-heading">IV. Shared Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        Every member contributes to the tone and quality of the community.  
        Moderation is one part of a wider ethic of care, discipline, and clarity upheld by all.
