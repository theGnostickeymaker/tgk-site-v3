        Moderation within the TGK Community is principled and minimal. It exists to preserve 
        the quality of dialogue and protect participants from degradation, not to suppress 
        disagreement or enforce ideological conformity.

      <h2 class="section-heading">Moderation Ethos</h2>
      <p>
        Moderators serve as custodians rather than authorities. Their purpose is to maintain 
        a space where serious thought can develop, where ideas are treated with rigour, and where
        users feel free to explore difficult questions without fear of ridicule.
