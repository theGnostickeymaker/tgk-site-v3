    <!-- INTRO -->
    <section class="section-block">
      <h1 class="section-heading">Participation Guide</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        This guide explains how to participate within the TGK Community in a way that 
        contributes to clarity, adds value to discussion, and respects the shared 
        standards of this space.
      </p>

    <!-- SECTION I -->
    <section class="section-block">
      <h2 class="section-heading">I. Posting</h2>
      <p>
        Create posts that are focused, clear, and rooted in sincere inquiry.  
        The TGK Community is not a space for rhetorical traps, emotional venting, or 
        adversarial performance. Present your question or perspective with the intention 
        of being understood, not applauded.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION II -->
    <section class="section-block">
      <h2 class="section-heading">II. Replying</h2>
      <p>
        All replies must begin with a fair summary of the argument you are responding to.  
        This is the Steel Man discipline. Without it, dialogue collapses into projection 
        and misunderstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not rush. Reflect, summarise, then respond.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION III -->
    <section class="section-block">
      <h2 class="section-heading">III. Navigating Topics</h2>
      <p>
        The forthcoming category structure will organise threads by theme.  
        Use categories carefully: misplaced posts disrupt clarity, and threads may be 
        moved or returned for refinement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION IV -->
    <section class="section-block">
      <h2 class="section-heading">IV. Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        Your presence shapes the quality of the community. Uphold discipline in how 
        you form arguments, ask questions, and engage with others.  
        The Community thrives through collective care, not passive consumption.
