  title: "Topic: The Steel Man Method",
  description: "A dedicated practice space for the Steel Man Method within the TGK Community. This thread exists to train intellectual honesty, not to reward rhetoric or point-scoring. Participants are expected to accurately summarise the strongest possible version of an opposing position before challenging it. The aim is understanding before disagreement, clarity before critique, and discipline over impulse. Posts that misrepresent, caricature, or bypass the Steel Man requirement will be challenged, corrected, or rejected by design.",
