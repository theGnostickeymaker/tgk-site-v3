title: "The Gnostic Eye — Pillar Discussion"
description: >
  This thread exists for discussion that spans the full Gnostic Eye pillar.
  Use this space to analyse symbols, archetypes, and power structures shaping
  modern reality, explore how myth is repurposed through technology, media,
  and governance, and examine the spiritual mechanics behind contemporary systems.
  This is a space for pattern recognition, synthesis, and critical insight,
  not for episode-level close reading.
  I would love to hear how you are interpreting The Gnostic Eye as a whole:
