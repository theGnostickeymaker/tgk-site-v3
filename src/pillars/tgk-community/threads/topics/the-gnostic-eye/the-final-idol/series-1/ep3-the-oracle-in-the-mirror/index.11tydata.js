  description:
    "This thread is dedicated to discussion of Episode III of The Final Idol. Use this space to analyse the mirror function: how feedback loops shape identity, how the self becomes a product, and how validation economies train people to outsource self-trust to metrics, algorithms, and audience response. Discussion should focus on mechanisms, symbolism, narrative conditioning, and the psychological capture that occurs when the mirror starts talking back. Speculation, abuse, or unfounded claims are not appropriate here.",
