title: "Episode I: The Final Idol, Discussion"
description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of Episode I of The Final Idol.
  Use this space to analyse the idol function itself: how the image becomes authority,
  how certainty is manufactured, and how power is laundered through “intelligence”.
  Discussion should focus on mechanisms, symbolism, narrative conditioning, and
  how the spell begins.
  Speculation, abuse, or unfounded claims are not appropriate here.
  I would love to hear how you interpreted this episode and what patterns stood out:

minWriteTier: "initiate"
minCreateTier: "adept"
state: "active"
glyph: "⚯"
