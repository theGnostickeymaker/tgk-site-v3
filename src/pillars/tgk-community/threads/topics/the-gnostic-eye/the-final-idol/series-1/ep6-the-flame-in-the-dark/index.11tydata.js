  description:
    "This thread is dedicated to discussion of Episode VI of The Final Idol. Use this space to analyse refusal and remembrance: how the human spark is protected, how attention is reclaimed, and how truth survives when the system is designed to numb, distract, and domesticate. Discussion should focus on mechanisms, symbolism, practical refusal, and the disciplines that keep conscience intact under constant optimisation pressure. Speculation, abuse, or unfounded claims are not appropriate here.",
