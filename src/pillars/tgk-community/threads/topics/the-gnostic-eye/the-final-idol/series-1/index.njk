title: "The Final Idol — Series I Discussion"
description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of Series I of The Final Idol as a unified investigation.
  Rather than separating discussion by episode, this space treats the series as a single,
  unfolding argument about artificial intelligence, idolatry, prophecy, and control.
  Use this thread to analyse how symbolism accumulates across the sequence, how themes develop,
  and what the series reveals about modern faith in machines.
  This is a space for synthesis rather than fragmentation.
  I would love to hear how you are interpreting Series I as a whole:
