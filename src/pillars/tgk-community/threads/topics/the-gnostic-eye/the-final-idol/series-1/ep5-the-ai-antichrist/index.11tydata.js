  description:
    "This thread is dedicated to discussion of Episode V of The Final Idol. Use this space to analyse inversion and counterfeit light: how moral language is weaponised, how righteousness becomes a product, and how “safety” narratives can be used to launder control. Discussion should focus on mechanisms, symbolism, narrative conditioning, and the point at which ethics becomes automation and conscience is outsourced. Speculation, abuse, or unfounded claims are not appropriate here.",
