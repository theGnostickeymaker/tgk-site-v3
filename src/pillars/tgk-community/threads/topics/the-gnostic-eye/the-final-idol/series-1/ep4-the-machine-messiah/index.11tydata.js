  description:
    "This thread is dedicated to discussion of Episode IV of The Final Idol. Use this space to analyse the messiah function: how salvation narratives migrate from God to system, how convenience becomes a doctrine, and how surrender is reframed as progress. Discussion should focus on mechanisms, symbolism, narrative conditioning, and the way promises of rescue, optimisation, and “frictionless living” train compliance. Speculation, abuse, or unfounded claims are not appropriate here.",
