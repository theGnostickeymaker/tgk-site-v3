    "Single discussion thread for Series I of The Final Idol as a unified investigation. This space treats the series as one unfolding argument about artificial intelligence, idolatry, prophecy, and control. Use it for synthesis: how symbolism accumulates across the sequence, how themes develop, and what the arc reveals about modern faith in machines.",
