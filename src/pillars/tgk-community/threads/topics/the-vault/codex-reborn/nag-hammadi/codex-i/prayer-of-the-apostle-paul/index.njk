title: "The Prayer of the Apostle Paul — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  The Prayer of the Apostle Paul is a brief but symbolically dense text,
  functioning as an invocation rather than a narrative or teaching discourse.
  It emphasises ascent, protection, authority, and alignment with the divine
  source before revelation unfolds.
  Use this thread to explore its ritual tone, theological assumptions,
  relationship to Pauline tradition, and its positioning at the threshold
  of Codex I.
