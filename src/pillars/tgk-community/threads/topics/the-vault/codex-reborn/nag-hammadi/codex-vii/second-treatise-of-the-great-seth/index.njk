title: "Second Treatise of the Great Seth — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  The Second Treatise of the Great Seth presents one of the most radical
  Christological texts in the Nag Hammadi Library. It rejects sacrificial
  theology, reframes the crucifixion as an archontic error, and presents
  Christ as laughing above the cross while false authorities execute an
  illusion.
  Use this thread to explore docetism, inversion of martyrdom, mockery of
  power, and the text’s critique of suffering-based salvation.
