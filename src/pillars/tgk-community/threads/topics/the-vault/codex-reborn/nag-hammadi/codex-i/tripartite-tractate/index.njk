title: "The Tripartite Tractate — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  The Tripartite Tractate is one of the most structurally ambitious texts in
  the Nag Hammadi Library. It presents a full cosmological map: from the
  ineffable Source, through emanation and error, into material fragmentation
  and the differentiated conditions of humanity.
  Use this thread to explore its metaphysical architecture, its account of
  salvation, its anthropology, and how it integrates myth, philosophy, and
  theology into a single system.
