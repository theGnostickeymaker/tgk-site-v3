description: >
  Zostrianos is one of the longest and most complex visionary texts in the
  Nag Hammadi Library. It presents an extended ascent narrative structured
  around multiple baptisms, purifications, and revelations across layered
  divine realms.
  Use this thread to explore Sethian metaphysics, ritual ascent, visionary
  mapping of reality, and the relationship between purification, knowledge,
  and liberation.
