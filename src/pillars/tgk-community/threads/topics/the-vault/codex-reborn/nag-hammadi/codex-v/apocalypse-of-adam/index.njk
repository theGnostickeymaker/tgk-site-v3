title: "The apocalypse of Adam — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  The apocalypse of Adam presents a primordial revelation narrative centred on
  false saviours, persecution of the true seed, and resistance to archontic deception.
  It reframes salvation history as a series of corrupt interventions masking the
  true knowledge.
  Use this thread to explore its mythic structure, polemical strategy, and
  relationship to Sethian and revelatory traditions in the Nag Hammadi Library.
