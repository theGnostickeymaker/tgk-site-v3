title: "Exegesis on the Soul — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  Exegesis on the Soul presents the soul as a fallen feminine figure,
  cast into exile through ignorance and violation, and restored through
  repentance, remembrance, and reunion with the divine Bridegroom.
  Drawing heavily on allegory, scripture, and poetic lament, the text
  reframes salvation as inner purification rather than legal redemption.
  Use this thread to explore its symbolic anthropology, gendered imagery,
  relationship to Platonic and biblical sources, and its role within
  the wider Nag Hammadi vision of return.
