title: "Nag Hammadi Library — Discussion"
description: >
  The Nag Hammadi Library comprises multiple codices preserving a wide range
  of Gnostic texts concerned with revelation, cosmology, salvation, error,
  and awakening.
  This discussion space is intended for cross-codex analysis, shared symbolic
  structures, theological continuities, divergences, and the broader shape
  of Gnostic thought across the Nag Hammadi corpus.
  It is not a discussion of any single codex or text, but of the library as
  a whole.
