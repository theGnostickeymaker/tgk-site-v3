title: "Treatise on the Resurrection — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  The Treatise on the Resurrection reframes resurrection not as a future
  physical event, but as a present spiritual awakening.
  It challenges bodily literalism, argues for a transformed mode of being,
  and places resurrection within lived gnosis rather than deferred hope.
  Use this thread to explore its metaphysics, anthropology, theological
  tensions with orthodox Christianity, and its place within Codex I.
