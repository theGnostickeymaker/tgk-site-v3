title: "Nag Hammadi — Codex VII Discussion"
description: >
  Codex VII presents some of the most theologically explicit and revelatory
  texts in the Nag Hammadi Library. Its writings articulate Sethian cosmology,
  divine self-disclosure, and the structure of transcendent reality through
  hymnic, visionary, and revelatory forms.
  Use this thread to explore emanation theology, sacred speech, identity,
  and resistance to false authority.
