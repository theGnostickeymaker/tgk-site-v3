title: "The Apocalypse of Paul — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  The Apocalypse of Paul presents a visionary ascent through layered heavens,
  revealing judgement mechanisms, archonic authorities, and the fate of souls.
  It radically reworks Pauline authority into a Gnostic revelation narrative,
  exposing salvation, punishment, and liberation beyond orthodox frameworks.
  Use this thread to explore its cosmology, symbolism, ethical vision,
  and relationship to other ascent and judgement traditions in the
  Nag Hammadi Library.
