description: >
  Trimorphic Protennoia presents a first-person divine revelation spoken by
  Protennoia, the primordial feminine intelligence. The text unfolds in three
  modes of manifestation, mapping descent into the material realm and return
  through awakening knowledge.
  Use this thread to explore divine speech, feminine cosmology, layered
  revelation, and the role of voice as a vehicle of liberation.
