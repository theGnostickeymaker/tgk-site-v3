title: "Three Steles of Seth — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  The Three Steles of Seth is a liturgical and hymnic text composed as a
  sequence of exalted praises addressed to the divine realm. Rather than
  narrative revelation, it functions as ritual speech, mapping ascent,
  identity, and belonging within Sethian cosmology.
  Use this thread to explore sacred language, ritual repetition, divine
  genealogy, and how praise itself operates as a technology of liberation.
