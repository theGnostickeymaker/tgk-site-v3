title: "The Gospel of Thomas — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  The Gospel of Thomas is a sayings collection attributed to the Living Jesus,
  stripped of narrative, miracle, and crucifixion in favour of direct aphorism
  and interior revelation. Its voice is paradoxical, destabilising, and often
  deliberately opaque, pointing repeatedly toward self-knowledge as the gateway
  to life.
  Use this thread to explore its logia, symbolic inversals, tensions with
  canonical Christianity, and its relationship to wider Gnostic themes such as
  awakening, concealment, and the Kingdom within.
