title: "The Gospel of Truth — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  The Gospel of Truth is a lyrical and meditative text traditionally associated
  with Valentinian Gnosticism. Rather than offering narrative or law, it presents
  ignorance as a form of error and salvation as remembrance of the Source.
  Use this thread to explore its symbolism, theology of awakening, relationship
  to other Codex I texts, and its distinctive vision of truth as restoration
  rather than judgement.
