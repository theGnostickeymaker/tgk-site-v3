title: "Sophia of Jesus Christ — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  Sophia of Jesus Christ reframes the philosophical cosmology of Eugnostos
  as a post-resurrection dialogue, integrating revelatory teaching with
  salvific instruction.
  Use this thread to examine its synthesis of myth and philosophy, its
  pedagogical structure, and its role as a bridge between abstract cosmology
  and narrative revelation.
