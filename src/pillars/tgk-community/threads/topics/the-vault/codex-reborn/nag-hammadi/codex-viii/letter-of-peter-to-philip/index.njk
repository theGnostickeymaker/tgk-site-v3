title: "Letter of Peter to Philip — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  The Letter of Peter to Philip presents apostolic correspondence reframed
  through post-resurrection revelation. It blends epistolary form with visionary
  discourse, confronting persecution, false powers, and the need for awakened
  understanding.
  Use this thread to explore apostolic authority, communal exhortation,
  revelation after suffering, and how legitimacy is re-established through
  direct encounter with the risen Christ.
