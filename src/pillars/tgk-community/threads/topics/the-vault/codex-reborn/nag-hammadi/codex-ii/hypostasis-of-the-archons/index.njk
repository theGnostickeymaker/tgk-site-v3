title: "Hypostasis of the Archons — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  Hypostasis of the Archons exposes the origins, limitations, and deceptions
  of the Archons, reframing Genesis as a drama of false authority, resistance,
  and awakening. The text reclaims Eve as a bearer of wisdom, unmasks the
  Demiurge as an ignorant ruler, and presents salvation as recognition rather
  than obedience.
  Use this thread to explore its reworking of biblical myth, its political
  theology of power, its portrayal of gender and resistance, and its role
  within the wider Gnostic critique of cosmic rule.
