title: "The Gospel of Mary — Discussion Thread"
description: >
  The Gospel of Mary presents post-resurrection teaching centred on inner
  ascent, liberation from hostile powers, and direct experiential knowledge.
  The text foregrounds Mary Magdalene as a legitimate bearer of revelation,
  provoking conflict with male disciples over authority and remembrance.
  Use this thread to explore feminine spiritual authority, the psychology of
  ascent, conflict over legitimacy, and how the Gospel of Mary reframes
  salvation as inward awakening rather than external obedience.
