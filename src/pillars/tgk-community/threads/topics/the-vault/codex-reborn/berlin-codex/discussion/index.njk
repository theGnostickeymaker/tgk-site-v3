title: "Berlin Codex — Discussion"
description: >
  The Berlin Codex preserves key Gnostic writings transmitted outside the
  Nag Hammadi Library. Its texts foreground marginalised apostolic voices,
  disputes over spiritual authority, and post-resurrection revelation that
  challenge later orthodox boundaries.
  Use this thread to explore transmission history, authority conflicts,
  gendered leadership, and the broader place of the Berlin Codex within
  early Christian diversity.
