title: "Codex Reborn — General Discussion"
description: >
  Codex Reborn brings together reconstructed Gnostic libraries,
  fragmented traditions, and recovered cosmologies preserved across
  multiple codices.
  Use this thread to explore cross-textual patterns, symbolic consistency,
  transmission history, translation challenges, and how these texts
  interlock with TGK investigations.
  This is a synthesis space for Codex Reborn as a whole, not a discussion
  of individual codices or texts.
  I would love to hear how you are reading Codex Reborn:

minWriteTier: "initiate"
minCreateTier: "adept"
state: "active"
glyph: "⟡"
