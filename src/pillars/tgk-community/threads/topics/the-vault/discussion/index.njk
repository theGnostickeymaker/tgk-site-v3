description: >
  This thread exists for discussion that spans the entire Vault archive.
  Use this space to compare translations, track recurring symbols, examine
  cosmology across traditions, and connect primary texts to TGK investigations.
  This is the correct place for synthesis across collections, not close reading
  of individual texts.
  I would love to hear how you are interpreting The Vault as a whole:

minWriteTier: "initiate"
