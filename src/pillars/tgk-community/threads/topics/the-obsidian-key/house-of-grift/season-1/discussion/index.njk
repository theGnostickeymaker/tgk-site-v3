title: "House of Grift — Season I Discussion"
description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of Season I of House of Grift as a coherent investigative arc.
  Use this space to analyse how individual cases connect, what patterns of protection and extraction
  recur across episodes, and how power consolidates through lineage, institutions, and silence.
  Episode-specific claims and evidence should be discussed in their respective threads.
  This is a space for careful analysis, not speculation.
  I would love to hear how you are interpreting Season I as a whole:
