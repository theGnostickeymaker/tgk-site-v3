title: "The Teachings — Pillar Discussion"
description: >
  This thread exists for discussion that spans the full Teachings pillar.
  Use this space to explore shared themes across traditions, compare metaphysical frameworks,
  question curriculum structure, and raise foundational inquiries that do not belong
  to any single series or episode.
  This is a place for synthesis, not fragmentation.
  I would love to hear how you are interpreting the Teachings as a whole:
