description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of House of Grift as a long-form investigative project.
  Use this space to examine themes that persist across seasons: hereditary entitlement, elite
  immunity, institutional shielding, media complicity, and the mechanics of extraction.
  Season-specific analysis should take place in the relevant season threads.
  This is a space for synthesis, pattern recognition, and serious analysis.
  I would love to hear how you are reading House of Grift as a whole:
