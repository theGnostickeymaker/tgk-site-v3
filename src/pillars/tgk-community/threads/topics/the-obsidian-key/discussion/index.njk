title: "The Obsidian Key — Pillar Discussion"
description: >
  This thread exists for discussion that spans the full Obsidian Key pillar.
  Use this space to connect investigations across series, examine recurring
  mechanisms of power and protection, and explore how law, empire, wealth,
  and violence are ritualised and normalised.
  This is the correct place for synthesis across cases, not detailed debate
  of individual episodes.
  I would love to hear how you are interpreting The Obsidian Key as a whole:

minWriteTier: "initiate"
