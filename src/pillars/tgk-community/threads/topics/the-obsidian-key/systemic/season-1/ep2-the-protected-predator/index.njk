description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of Episode II of House of Grift.
  Use this space to examine how institutions respond when reputational risk
  threatens entrenched power, including the deployment of legal insulation,
  media deflection, and strategic silence.
  Discussion should focus on structural protection mechanisms rather than
  sensationalism or speculation.
  Claims should be grounded in evidence, patterns, and institutional behaviour.
  I would love to hear what stood out to you in this episode:
