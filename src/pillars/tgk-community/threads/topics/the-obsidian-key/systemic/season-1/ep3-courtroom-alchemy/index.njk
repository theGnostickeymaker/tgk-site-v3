title: "Episode III: Courtroom Alchemy — Discussion"
description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of Episode III of SYSTEMIC: Courtroom Alchemy.
  Use this space to examine how courtroom architecture, procedural language, plea
  incentives, and administrative silence shape outcomes in the criminal justice system.
  Focus on observable practice: courtroom layout, judicial scripting, plea pressure,
  unrepresented defendants, vulnerability thresholds, and the diminishing role of juries.
  Contributions should reference concrete procedures, cases, policies, or lived experience
  where possible.
  Counter-arguments are welcome where grounded in evidence and articulated in good faith.
  Speculation, abuse, or unfounded claims are not appropriate here.
  I would particularly like to hear which courtroom rituals or practices most changed
  how you understand consent and fairness in criminal proceedings.
