description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of Episode I of SYSTEMIC: The Erosion Code.
  Use this space to analyse the UK’s rights architecture as a system: how statutes, guidance,
  enforcement practice, and crisis narratives combine over time. Focus on specific provisions,
  real-world application, and the language used to justify expansion.
  Counter-arguments are welcome where grounded in evidence and articulated in good faith.
  Speculation, abuse, or unfounded claims are not appropriate here.
  I would love to hear how you interpreted this episode and which moments in the staircase stood out:
