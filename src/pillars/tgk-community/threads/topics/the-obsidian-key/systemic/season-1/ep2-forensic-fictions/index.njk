title: "Episode II: Forensic Fictions — Discussion"
description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of Episode II of SYSTEMIC: Forensic Fictions.
  Use this space to examine how forensic science, expert testimony, and evidentiary
  rituals operate inside the UK legal system.
  Focus on the gap between scientific validity and courtroom authority: junk science,
  probabilistic abuse, institutional incentives, disclosure failures, and the cultural
  power of the “expert”.
  Contributions should reference specific cases, methods, judgments, or procedural
  mechanisms where possible.
  Counter-arguments are welcome where grounded in evidence and articulated in good faith.
  Speculation, abuse, or unfounded claims are not appropriate here.
  I would particularly like to hear which forensic practices or cases most challenged
  your assumptions about truth in court.
