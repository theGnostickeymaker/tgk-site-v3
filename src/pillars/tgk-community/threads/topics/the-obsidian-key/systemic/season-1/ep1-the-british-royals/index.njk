description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of Episode I of House of Grift.
  Use this space to analyse the British monarchy as a system of entitlement,
  extraction, and symbolic authority rather than as individual personalities.
  Discussion should focus on institutional structure, financial mechanisms,
  narrative protection, and historical continuity.
  Speculation, abuse, or unfounded claims are not appropriate here.
  I would love to hear how you interpreted this episode and what patterns stood out:
