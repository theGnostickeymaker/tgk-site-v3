description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of Episode III of House of Grift.
  Use this space to examine the function of minor royals within dynastic systems,
  including symbolic legitimacy, access brokerage, and reputational buffering.
  Discussion should focus on structural roles, institutional incentives, and
  financial or symbolic utility rather than personal attack or speculation.
  Evidence, patterns, and documented behaviour should guide contributions.
  I would love to hear what insights or connections stood out to you in this episode:
