description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of SYSTEMIC as a long form investigative project.
  Use this space to examine themes that persist across seasons: rights erosion by statute and procedure,
  surveillance normalisation, protest governance, administrative control, and the manufacture of consent language.
  Season specific analysis should take place in the relevant season threads.
  This is a space for synthesis, pattern recognition, and serious analysis.
  I would love to hear how you are reading SYSTEMIC as a whole:
