  This episode explores the Kabbalistic understanding of the soul as a fragment of divine light
  descending through worlds and returning through repair. Death is not a rupture but a transition,
  governed by judgment, rectification (tikkun), and ascent through layered realms of being.
  The afterlife is inseparable from ethical action, intention, and the restoration of cosmic balance.
  I would love to hear how you interpret these teachings:
