title: "Season I: Maps of the Afterlife — Season Discussion"
description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of Season I: Maps of the Afterlife as a coherent whole.
  Use this space to compare themes across the six traditions, examine recurring symbols and
  thresholds, and explore how different cultures map death, rebirth, judgement, and liberation.
  Episode-specific interpretation should live in the individual tradition threads.
  I would love to hear how you are reading Season I as a unified journey:
