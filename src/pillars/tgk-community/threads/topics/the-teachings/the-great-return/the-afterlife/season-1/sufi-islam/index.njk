  This episode explores the Sufi understanding of death not as an end, but as a return.
  The self is refined through love, annihilated in truth (fana), and restored in conscious
  subsistence (baqa). Paradise and hell are not merely future destinations but interior
  states shaped by remembrance, intention, and proximity to the Beloved.
  I would love to hear how you interpret these teachings:
