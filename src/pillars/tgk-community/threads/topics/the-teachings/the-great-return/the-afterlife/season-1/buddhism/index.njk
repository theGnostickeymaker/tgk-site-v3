  This episode presents death not as a final event, but as a transitional process shaped by
  mind, habit, and attachment. Rebirth unfolds through conditioned momentum, while liberation
  depends on insight into impermanence, non-self, and the cessation of craving.
  In traditions such as the Bardos, the interval between lives becomes a critical window
  for awakening rather than judgment.
  I would love to hear how you interpret these teachings:
