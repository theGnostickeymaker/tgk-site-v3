description: >
  This episode explores Mesoamerican understandings of death as a journey shaped by courage,
  ritual obligation, and cosmological order rather than moral reward or punishment.
  The soul passes through layered realms governed by natural forces, ancestral memory,
  and cyclical renewal, with destiny determined by manner of death as much as by conduct.
  The afterlife here is a continuation of cosmic rhythm, not an escape from it.
  I would love to hear how you interpret these teachings:
