title: "The Afterlife — Series Discussion"
description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of The Afterlife as a unified sub-series
  within The Great Return. Use this space to compare and contrast global afterlife
  cosmologies, explore recurring symbols and thresholds, and examine how different
  traditions understand death, rebirth, judgement, and liberation.
  Season-specific or tradition-specific discussion should live in their respective
  threads.
  I would love to hear how you are interpreting The Afterlife as a whole:
