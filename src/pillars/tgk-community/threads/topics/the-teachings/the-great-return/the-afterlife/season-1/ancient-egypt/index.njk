title: "Ancient Egypt Discussion Thread"
description: >
  This Epidode explores the Egyptian understanding of death as a continuation of ordered life
  rather than an abrupt ending. The soul unfolds through multiple aspects, judged by truth
  and weighed against Ma’at, before entering renewed existence among the justified.
  The afterlife is sustained through ritual, remembrance, and alignment with cosmic order,
  not blind belief or moral panic.
  I would love to hear how you interpret these teachings:
