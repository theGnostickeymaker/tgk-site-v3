title: "The Great Return — Series Discussion"
description: >
  This thread is dedicated to discussion of The Great Return as a unified series.
  Use this space to explore its overarching initiatory structure, symbolic logic,
  and recurring themes of remembrance, death, rebirth, and return.
  This is the correct place for insights that cut across sub-series such as
  The Afterlife, Temple of the Afterlife, and The Human Question.
  Episode-specific discussion should live in their respective threads.
  I would love to hear how you are interpreting The Great Return as a whole:
