  This scroll tells a disruptive story: a hidden Source beyond the cosmos, a fractured act of creation, and a world that behaves like a convincing imitation rather than the real thing.

  Sophia’s fall births a blind maker, the Archons manage the system, and the “divine spark” is concealed inside human life as both prison and escape route. Eden, in this reading, is not a children’s tale about disobedience, but an early parable about awakening.

  I would love to hear how you interpret it:

minWriteTier: "initiate"
minCreateTier: "adept"
state: "active"
glyph: "⚯"
