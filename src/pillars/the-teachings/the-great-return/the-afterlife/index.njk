      <p>
        <strong>The Afterlife</strong> forms the first gate of <em>The Great Return</em>.  
        It gathers the world’s most enduring maps of the soul’s passage and preserves 
        the teachings that power, empire, and institutional religion have attempted to suppress.  
        These pages explore what unfolds as breath departs the body, how consciousness 
        journeys through unseen realms, and how memory shapes destiny.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each tradition reveals a distinct fragment of a greater unity.  
        Some describe trials, others speak of judgement, liberation through knowledge,  
        or the cycles of time. All echo a single Gnostic truth: the journey after death 
        mirrors the journey within life. Nothing is lost. All paths return to their origin.
      </p>

      <p>
        These scrolls illuminate afterlife cosmologies, the rights and dignity of the dead,  
        the power of remembrance, and the soul’s potential to ascend.  
        They are offered as a guide for readers who seek to understand the unseen world  
        and to recognise their place within it.
