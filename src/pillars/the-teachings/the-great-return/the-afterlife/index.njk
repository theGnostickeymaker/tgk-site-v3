    <p>
      <strong>The Afterlife</strong> is the first gate of <em>The Great Return</em>. It gathers the world’s oldest maps of the soul’s journey and preserves the teachings that power, empire, and organised religion have attempted to erase. These pages chart what happens when breath leaves the body, how consciousness travels, and how memory shapes fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each tradition reveals a different fragment of the same truth. Some speak of trials, some of judgement, some of liberation through knowledge, and some of cyclical time. All of them echo the Gnostic insight that the journey after death mirrors the journey within life. Nothing is wasted. Everything returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      These scrolls explain afterlife cosmologies, the rights of the dead, the powers of remembrance, and the soul’s capacity to ascend. They are offered as a guide for those who wish to understand the unseen world and to recognise their own place within it.
