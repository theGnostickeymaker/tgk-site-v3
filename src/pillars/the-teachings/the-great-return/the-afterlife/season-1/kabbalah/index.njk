      <p>
        <strong>Kabbalah</strong> describes how the Infinite 
        (<em>Ein Sof</em>) emanates into creation through the ten 
        <strong>Sefirot</strong> of the <em>Tree of Life</em> — a map of descent, 
        purification, and return. Each threshold reveals a different mode of divine 
        presence and a stage in the soul’s unfolding.
      </p>

      <p>
        This three-part Season follows the soul’s descent into form, its refinement 
        through the luminous pathways of the Tree, and its ascent back to 
        <strong>Tiferet</strong>, where harmony between the celestial and the earthly 
        becomes unified. It is a symbolic architecture of creation and a guide for the 
        soul’s remembrance of its origin.
