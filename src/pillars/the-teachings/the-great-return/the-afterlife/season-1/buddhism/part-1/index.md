    <span>&ldquo;Samsāra has no beginning that can be seen.&rdquo;</span>
    <cite> Saṃyutta Nikāya</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In Buddhist cosmology, reality is not linear. It spirals.</p>
  <p>This spiral is called <strong>Samsāra, </strong>the Wheel of Becoming, where beings move through lifetimes across six realms: god, demigod, human, animal, hungry ghost, and hell-being. Each realm is both literal and symbolic: places of rebirth, but also <em>states of mind</em> we drift through daily.</p>
  <p>The wheel spins because of <strong>karma, </strong>intentional actions and <strong>taṇhā,</strong> craving. Like gravity, karma pulls. Like fire, it burns. We chase, we cling, we become and so we are reborn.</p>
  <p>But this cycle is not eternal law, it is <em>conditioned</em>. What is conditioned can be <strong>unconditioned</strong>. The Buddha did not teach how to make a better ride on the wheel, he taught how to <em>step off</em> it.</p>
  <p>Theravāda emphasises anattā (no-self), viewing rebirth as a process without a permanent soul, while Mahāyāna&rsquo;s Pure Land tradition trusts in Amitābha Buddha&rsquo;s vow to guide devotees to a rebirth-free paradise. Vajrayāna, our focus in part III, illuminates the bardo&rsquo;s visionary path.</p>
  <p>For the Gnostic seeker, this teaching resonates: the world is not a blessing, but a trap of recurrence. Liberation is not ascension through the realms, but <strong>departure from the cycle itself</strong>.</p>

    <span>&ldquo;It is intention, monks, that I call karma.&rdquo;</span>
    <cite> Anguttara Nikāya</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>Karma</strong> is not fate. It is not divine punishment, nor cosmic reward.  
  In the Buddha&rsquo;s words: karma is <em>intention</em>.</p>

  <p>Every thought, word, and action plants a seed, shaping the conditions that follow. This is not metaphysics, it is the observable architecture of becoming.</p>

  <p>Like a machine, karma generates momentum. The wheel turns not by accident, but because we fuel it: with craving, resistance, grasping, fear.</p>

  <p>But karma is not static. Its engine can be stopped. In fact, that&rsquo;s the aim of the Buddhist path, to end the cycle by ending the fuel. To act <em>without clinging</em>. To do <em>without becoming</em>.</p>

  <p>For Gnostic seekers, this resembles the Archonic system, a spiritual mechanism built on false desire and illusion. Karma is the script of the false world. Liberation requires stepping beyond the script entirely.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>In Buddhist cosmology, the six realms of existence are often described as literal rebirths, but they are also <strong>mirrors of mind</strong>. You do not need to die to visit them. You pass through them daily.</p>

  <p>They are:</p>
  <ul class="list-emoji">
    <li><strong>Deva (God) Realm</strong> &mdash; pleasure, distraction, spiritual pride</li>
    <li><strong>Asura (Demigod) Realm</strong> &mdash; jealousy, egoic striving, competition</li>
    <li><strong>Human Realm</strong> &mdash; balance of joy and suffering, potential for awakening</li>
    <li><strong>Animal Realm</strong> &mdash; instinct, fear, survival, ignorance</li>
    <li><strong>Hungry Ghost Realm</strong> &mdash; addiction, craving, insatiable desire</li>
    <li><strong>Hell Realm</strong> &mdash; rage, agony, torment, hatred</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These are not punishments, they are <em>reflections</em>. Each realm reveals a dominant state of consciousness. Each one is a teaching. And every moment is a crossroads: which realm are you in?</p>

  <p>The Buddha taught that the human realm is the rarest, because it balances <strong>clarity and suffering</strong>. It offers the best chance for awakening. Gnostics would call it the midpoint of the labyrinth, where the false light and true light are both visible.</p>

  <p>To understand the realms is to understand the self. To pass through them consciously is to begin breaking the wheel.</p>

    <span>&ldquo;When this is, that is. From the arising of this, that arises.&rdquo;</span>
    <cite> The Buddha, on Dependent Origination</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Buddha taught that suffering is not random, it is structured.  
  A patterned chain. A recursive loop.</p>

  <p>This structure is called <strong>Paṭicca-Samuppāda, </strong> Dependent Origination.  
  It describes the twelve interlinked links of becoming, each giving rise to the next:</p>

  <ol class="list-emoji">
    <li><strong>Ignorance (avijjā)</strong> &mdash; Not knowing the true nature of reality. The primal blindness to impermanence, non-self, and the nature of suffering. It is the root illusion that sets the cycle in motion.</li>
  <li><strong>Volitional Formations (saṅkhāra)</strong> &mdash; Conditioned impulses or karmic actions, shaped by ignorance. These are the seeds, mental, verbal, physical, that shape future experiences.</li>
  <li><strong>Consciousness (viññāṇa)</strong> &mdash; Awareness conditioned by past karma. This is not pure awareness, but a specific stream of perception tied to karmic tendencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Name and Form (nāma-rūpa)</strong> &mdash; The arising of body and mind: sensation, perception, thought, identity. Consciousness crystallises into a new being.</li>
  <li><strong>Six Sense Spheres (saḷāyatana)</strong> &mdash; The development of the five senses and the mind as a sixth. The apparatus of perception is re-established.</li>
  <li><strong>Contact (phassa)</strong> &mdash; When the senses meet objects, contact arises, a spark between subject and object.</li>
  <li><strong>Feeling (vedanā)</strong> &mdash; From contact arises feeling: pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. This is the raw experience of sensation.</li>
  <li><strong>Craving (taṇhā)</strong> &mdash; Feeling gives rise to desire, the thirst to possess, to avoid, or to repeat. The mind begins to reach.</li>
  <li><strong>Clinging (upādāna)</strong> &mdash; Craving intensifies into attachment. The mind grabs onto ideas, identities, objects, relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Becoming (bhava)</strong> &mdash; Clinging sets into motion the process of becoming, the karmic momentum that conditions the next existence.</li>
  <li><strong>Birth (jāti)</strong> &mdash; The arising of a new life, form, or identity, not only literal birth, but any moment we "become" something again.</li>
  <li><strong>Decay and Death (jarāmaraṇa)</strong> &mdash; Every arising ends. With birth comes aging, dissolution, and death, followed by grief, lamentation, and the wheel beginning again.</li>
</ol>

  <p>This is the engine of Samsāra, a loop that creates identity, rebirth, and suffering.  
  But it is not eternal. Each link is <em>conditional</em>.  
  If you break one link, the chain <strong>stops</strong>.</p>

  <p>Gnostic teachings echo this. The soul, caught in the Archons&rsquo; illusions, descends through layers of ignorance and craving.  
  But at any gate, it can <strong>remember</strong>. It can turn back.</p>

  <p>To see the links is to weaken them.  
  To see the wheel is to begin stepping off.</p>

    <span>&ldquo;With ignorance as condition, formations arise.&rdquo;</span>
    <cite> Paṭicca-Samuppāda, Link 1</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>All things begin in forgetting.</p>

  <p>In Buddhism, the first link of the cycle of rebirth is <strong>avijjā, </strong>ignorance.  
  Not mere lack of knowledge, but the <em>primordial blindness</em> to the truth of impermanence, non-self, and suffering.</p>

  <p>It is the ignorance that believes in a fixed &ldquo;I,&rdquo; that grasps for permanence in the impermanent,  
  that mistakes craving for joy and the world for a home. It is this illusion that births karma, and the entire wheel turns from there.</p>

  <p>The Gnostic vision mirrors this:  
  we are born not in innocence, but in amnesia. The soul forgets its origin in the Pleroma.  
  Memory fades. The divine spark is buried. The veil falls.</p>

  <p>This is the <strong>Great Forgetting, </strong>and every birth is a repetition of it.</p>

  <p>In Buddhist cosmology, existence spans six realms, each shaped by karma, each offering a distorted mirror of the mind. These realms are:</p>

  <ol class="list-emoji">
    <li><strong>Deva (God) Realm</strong> &mdash;a realm of bliss and beauty, but sedated by spiritual pride and complacency</li>
    <li><strong>Asura (Demi-God) Realm</strong> &mdash; dominated by jealousy, rivalry, and restless striving</li>
    <li><strong>Human Realm</strong> &mdash; balanced between pleasure and suffering, it offers the clearest chance for awakening</li>
    <li><strong>Animal Realm</strong> &mdash; ruled by instinct, ignorance, and fear</li>
    <li><strong>Preta (Hungry Ghost) Realm</strong> &mdash; defined by insatiable craving and emotional famine</li>
    <li><strong>Naraka (Hell) Realm</strong> &mdash; tormented by rage, hatred, and anguish</li>
  </ol>

  <p>These are not just post-mortem destinations, they are <strong>states of consciousness</strong> that rise and fall within a single day, or a single life.  
  One moment in divine ease, the next in ghost-like hunger. This is the inner wheel.</p>

  <p>To see the realms as mirrors is to begin waking. What we experience &ldquo;out there&rdquo; is often the echo of what moves within.  
  For the Gnostic, this understanding deepens: each realm is not just psychological, but <em>symbolic architecture,</em> astral projections shaped by karma, ignorance, and archonic interference.</p>

  <p>The great task is not to escape upward, but to pierce the illusion of all realms. Even heaven is samsāra. Even pleasure binds.</p>

    <cite> The Buddha, on the Middle Way</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After abandoning a life of princely luxury, the Buddha turned to extreme asceticism, fasting, silence, self-punishment. But he found no peace. His body collapsed. His mind frayed.</p>

  <p>Then came the revelation: <strong>neither indulgence nor denial</strong> liberate the soul. Both are traps. The path lies in the middle, fierce in discipline, yet free from violence.</p>

  <p>This is the <strong>Middle Way</strong>: a razor&rsquo;s edge. It does not reject desire with hatred, nor embrace it with craving. It meets the fire <em>without burning</em>.</p>

  <p>For the Gnostic, this teaching resonates as a method of <em>gnosis-in-the-world</em>: one must walk awake in a realm of illusion without falling for its temptations, nor fleeing into spiritual bypassing. The world must be met and seen through, not denied or decorated.</p>

  <p>Balance is not softness, it is <strong>fire under control</strong>. Discipline with compassion. Awareness that does not flinch.</p>

  <p>In Buddhist teaching, death is not the end. It is a moment of tremendous significance, a <strong>gateway</strong> where the illusions of solidity, self, and control dissolve.</p>

  <p>At death, the body collapses, but the stream of consciousness does not vanish. It moves. It carries forward the imprints of karma, memories, tendencies, unfinished desires, into the space between lives.</p>

  <p>This is the entry into the <strong>Bardo</strong>: the in-between state. A place of dreams, visions, revelations, and distortions, all shaped by the mind&rsquo;s habits.</p>

  <p>For the Gnostic, this threshold echoes the moment of the soul&rsquo;s <em>separation from the counterfeit body,</em> a peeling away from the illusion of form to face the mirror of truth.</p>

  <p>To die consciously is to pass through this gate with awareness. Not to escape fear, but to meet it without clinging.</p>

  <p>In the Bardo, there is no body, only <strong>mind</strong>. But the mind is not empty. It creates.</p>

  <p>Everything repressed, ignored, denied, or craved begins to arise in dream-like form.  
  Frightening visions. Beautiful illusions. Longing. Guilt. Bliss. Regret.</p>

  <p>This is not punishment, it is <em>reflection</em>.  
  The Bardo becomes a <strong>mirror of the mind</strong>, a psychic theatre where karmic imprints play out in full color.</p>

  <p>If the soul panics, it grasps at these visions and falls into a new rebirth.  
  If the soul remains calm and aware, it recognises these appearances as <em>mind-made,</em> and may transcend them.</p>

  <p>Gnostic parallels are profound. The Archons project illusions to trap the soul. But those illusions have no power once seen for what they are: shadows of the self. The awakened mind does not fight the dream, it <strong>sees through it</strong>.</p>

  <p>On the second week in the Bardo, <strong>figures of dazzling light and terrible form</strong> begin to appear.</p>

  <p>Some radiate compassion and peace, these are the <em>peaceful deities</em>. Others roar in flame and shadow, these are the <em>wrathful deities</em>. Both are aspects of the same truth.</p>

  <p>They are not gods in the Western sense. They are <strong>projections of the soul&rsquo;s mind</strong>, infused with karmic charge. If one meets them with terror or desire, the soul recoils, and spirals into rebirth. But if one sees through the projection, the deity becomes a portal of release.</p>

  <p>To the Gnostic, these figures echo the Archons and Aeons, symbolic powers that appear to the soul at threshold moments. The Archons seek to bind; the Aeons to awaken. But both are masks. Only the <strong>unconditioned spark</strong> beneath them is real.</p>
