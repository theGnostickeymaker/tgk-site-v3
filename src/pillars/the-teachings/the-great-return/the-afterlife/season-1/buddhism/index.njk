      <p>
        <strong>Buddhism</strong> describes liberation from suffering and rebirth through
        insight, compassion, and the direct recognition of mind’s nature. Across this
        three-part Season, we explore the great Wheel and its six realms, the Bodhisattva’s
        vow, and the Vajrayāna teachings on the Clear Light after death.
      </p>

      <p>
        This cycle reveals how the afterlife mirrors the mind itself. Liberation begins
        when illusion is unveiled, presence stabilised, and awareness recognised as the
        ground beneath all appearances.
