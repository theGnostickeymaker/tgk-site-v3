      <p>
        <strong>Buddhism</strong> maps liberation from suffering and rebirth through compassion,
        insight, and the direct recognition of mind’s true nature. Across this three-part season,
        we explore the Six Realms of the great Wheel, the Bodhisattva’s vow of return, and the
        Vajrayāna teachings on the Clear Light of the Bardos after death.
      </p>

      <p>
        This cycle reveals that the afterlife reflects the mind itself. Liberation begins when
        illusion is recognised, presence stabilised, and awareness revealed as the ground beneath
        all appearances. What dies is not the mind, but the mistaken identity the mind once carried.
