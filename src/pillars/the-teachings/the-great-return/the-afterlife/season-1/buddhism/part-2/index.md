  </blockquote>

  <p>In Buddhist cosmology, life is not a single thread but a vast wheel, <strong>saṃsāra</strong>, the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Each turn conditioned by karma, each return shaped by craving and ignorance.</p>

  <p>The soul, or rather, the stream of consciousness, clings to form, sensation, becoming. What is reborn is not a fixed &ldquo;self,&rdquo; but a flow of conditioned tendencies, endlessly chasing fulfillment, endlessly circling back.</p>

  <p>Why does the wheel spin? Because the mind grasps. Because desire burns. Because ignorance veils the path beyond.</p>

  <p>The Buddha&rsquo;s teaching is not to escape life, but to end the <strong>compulsion</strong> to repeat it. To step off the wheel by seeing clearly, acting purely, and loosening the fetters that bind us to return.</p>

  <p>In Buddhist thought, karma is not reward or punishment, it is <strong>cause and effect</strong>.</p>

  <p>Every thought, word, and action plants a seed. These seeds ripen over time, shaping the conditions of future experience. No god assigns fate; no external judge hands down decrees. We walk inside the garden we ourselves have sown.</p>

  <p>Crucially, karma is not fate. It is <strong>conditioned becoming</strong>. Old seeds shape the soil, but new choices can change the harvest.</p>

  <p>This is why the Buddha taught: <em>act with awareness</em>. Cultivate good roots: compassion, patience, wisdom. Weed out harmful roots: anger, greed, delusion.</p>

  <p>The chain of cause is unbroken, but at every link, there is choice.</p>

  <p>In Buddhist cosmology, rebirth is not about a soul jumping body to body, it is the continuation of <strong>process</strong>.</p>

  <p>When conditions are right, consciousness arises again.  
  When old karma ripens, it shapes the next becoming.</p>

  <p>This is <em>saṃsāra</em>: the wheel of birth and death, spun by craving, ignorance, and clinging.</p>

  <p>The wheel turns through six realms, gods, titans, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings, but all are impermanent.  
  All are marked by dukkha: unsatisfactoriness.</p>

  <p>Rebirth is not destiny, but inertia. To break free, the Buddha taught, one must break the inner chains: craving, aversion, delusion.</p>

  <p>With insight and practice, the wheel can stop turning.</p>

  <p>Karma is often misunderstood.</p>

  <p>It is not cosmic punishment or reward.  
  It is not a divine ledger keeping score.</p>

  <p>Karma means <strong>action,</strong> intentional action, shaped by mind. Every thought, word, and deed leaves an imprint, ike ripples on a vast sea.</p>

  <p>These ripples combine, amplify, collide, shaping not just the future, but the <em>shape</em> of the one who acts.</p>

  <p>The Buddha taught: &ldquo;What you are is what you have done. What you will be is what you do now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There is no fixed self, but there is momentum. Karma is the great sculptor, and mind is the chisel.</p>

  <p>The Buddhist afterlife is not just a passage, it is a <strong>teaching ground</strong>.</p>

  <p>Every bardo, every rebirth, every encounter with suffering is a <em>Dharma gate,</em> a threshold through which the soul can awaken.</p>

  <p>But these gates do not open automatically. They require <strong>presence</strong>, <strong>intention</strong>, and <strong>clear seeing</strong>.</p>

  <p>The awakened practitioner learns to pass through these gates while alive: in every moment of fear, attachment, or confusion,they ask, <em>What is this showing me? What is the Dharma here?</em></p>

  <p>In other words, do not cling, not even to awakening itself. The Dharma gate of liberation is boundless because it is ever-shifting.</p>

  <p>Every experience becomes a chance to <strong>unbind</strong> the self, to loosen the karmic chains, and to glimpse the radiant empty freedom beyond form.</p>

  <p>In the Buddhist vision, the afterlife is not ruled by external judges. There is no divine figure weighing your fate.</p>

  <p>Instead, you stand before the <strong>mirror of karma</strong>: the reflection of your own deeds, intentions, and mental formations.</p>

  <p>Every action leaves an imprint. Every thought shapes the next unfolding. This is not punishment or reward, it is <em>resonance</em>.</p>

  <p>As the <strong>bardo soul</strong> navigates the liminal states, it encounters these karmic reflections. Pleasant forms arise from compassion and generosity. Frightening visions arise from anger, greed, or delusion.</p>

  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    &ldquo;You are not punished for your anger, you are punished by your anger.&rdquo;<br>
    <cite> Buddhist teaching</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But even here, the wise know: these visions are <strong>empty</strong>. They are projections of the mind.</p>

  <p>The awakened practitioner does not cling to the beautiful or fear the terrifying. They walk through the mirror, knowing:

  <p>At the end of the bardo journey, a gate waits: the <strong>Gate of Rebirth</strong>.</p>

  <p>If the soul has not achieved liberation, if it clings to desire, fear, or identity, it is drawn back into the <em>wheel of becoming</em>.</p>

  <p>This is not punishment. It is the natural momentum of karmic patterns.</p>

  <p>The Tibetan texts describe visions at this gate: couples embracing, the pull of attraction, the surge of craving. These are not merely images, they are the karmic hooks pulling the soul into a new womb, a new life, a new cycle.</p>

  <p>What lies beyond the gate, if the soul does not return?</p>

  <p>The Buddha called it <strong>nirvāṇa,</strong> a state not of annihilation, but of release.</p>

  <p>It is the end of becoming. The extinguishing of the fires: greed, hatred, delusion.</p>

  <p>In nirvāṇa, there is no more clinging, no more thirst, no more &ldquo;I&rdquo; trying to become.</p>

  <p>The <em>Theravāda</em> texts speak of it as the unconditioned: that which is not born, does not arise, and does not pass away.</p>

  <p>In the Mahāyāna tradition, the story shifts.</p>

  <p>Not all who stand at the gate choose to cross. Some turn back.</p>

  <p>These are the <strong>bodhisattvas,</strong> beings who have realised the emptiness of all things, who stand at the threshold of nirvāṇa, but choose to remain in the world of suffering.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>For love.</p>

  <p>The bodhisattva sees that no being is separate. That liberation is incomplete if even one soul remains trapped in ignorance.</p>

  <p>So they take the vow: to delay their own final freedom until <em>all</em> beings are free.</p>

  <p>What lies at the core of all Buddhist realisation?</p>

  <p>Not a thing. Not a god.  
  But <strong>śūnyatā,</strong> emptiness.</p>

  <p>Emptiness is not void, not nothingness. It is the realisation that all things lack inherent, independent existence.</p>

  <p>Body, mind, thought, self, time, space all are woven from interdependence, arising and falling like waves on the ocean.</p>

  <p>In Tibetan Buddhism, this emptiness reveals itself as the <strong>clear light,</strong> the luminous, formless awareness underlying all experience.</p>

  <p>It is not something to be added or achieved. It is what remains when clinging stops, when self dissolves, when the mind rests in its own nature.</p>
