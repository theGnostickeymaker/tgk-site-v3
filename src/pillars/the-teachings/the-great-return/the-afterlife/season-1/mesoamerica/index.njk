      <p>
        <strong>Mesoamerican afterlife cosmology</strong> reveals a universe where 
        <em>time is alive</em>: cyclical, breathing, and eternally returning. The Maya and 
        Mexica saw existence as a serpent of light that coils through creation, dissolution, 
        and rebirth — a rhythm echoed in their temples, calendars, and rites.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their sacred calendars, the <em>Tzolk’in</em> and <em>Haab</em>, aligned human life with the 
        heavens. Pyramids were astronomical instruments as much as tombs, and death was a 
        transition into the patterned landscape of <em>Xibalba</em> or <em>Mictlán</em>, where trials, winds, 
        obsidian blades, and divine messengers shaped the soul’s descent.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this three-part Season, we follow the soul’s movement through the calendar of ages, 
        the trials beneath the earth, and the spiral ascent towards the maize-born heavens. 
        To understand Mesoamerica is to understand time as a temple, a pathway, and a return.
