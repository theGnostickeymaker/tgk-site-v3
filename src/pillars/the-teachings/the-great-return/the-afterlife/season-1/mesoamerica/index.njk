      <p>
        <strong>Mesoamerican afterlife cosmology</strong> reveals a world where <em>time itself is sacred</em>, 
        not linear, but cyclical, a living serpent that coils through creation, death, and rebirth.
        The Maya and Mexica built temples aligned with the heavens, recording cosmic rhythm in the
        <em>Tzolk’in</em> and <em>Haab</em> calendars, and carved eternity into stone.
      </p>
      <p>
        To die was not to end, but to move in rhythm with the gods. Each soul followed its own
        calendrical destiny, through <em>Xibalba</em> or <em>Mictlán</em>, guided by sacred dogs and the
        breath of jade. Their architecture, mathematics, and myth were not separate — they were
        one sacred science: <strong>the architecture of time itself</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this three-part journey, we explore how the ancients mapped the calendar of souls,
        encoded the serpent of light into the pyramid, and remembered that to align with time
        is to align with eternity.
