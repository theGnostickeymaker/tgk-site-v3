      <p>
        <strong>Ancient Egyptian afterlife teachings</strong> preserve one of humanity’s oldest maps of the soul’s return.
        Shaped by <em>Ma’at</em>, the cosmic law of truth and balance, the dead were judged not by belief but by resonance.
        Every soul had to remember its name (<em>Ren</em>), nourish its essence (<em>Ka</em>), and pass through the
        twelve gates of the <em>Duat</em> before becoming <em>Akh</em>, radiant eternal light.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this three-part journey, we follow the soul’s path from ritual preservation and mummification,
        through the Duat’s trials, guardians, and passwords, to the Weighing of the Heart and the birth of the immortal Akh.
        What the Egyptians called resurrection, the Gnostics would later understand as <em>gnosis</em>,
        the remembrance of the divine identity concealed within.
