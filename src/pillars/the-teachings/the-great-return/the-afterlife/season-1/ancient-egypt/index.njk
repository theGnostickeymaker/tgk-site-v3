      <p>
        <strong>Ancient Egyptian afterlife teachings</strong> preserve one of humanity’s oldest maps of the soul’s return.
        Guided by <em>Ma’at</em>, the cosmic law of truth, balance, and resonance, the journey of the dead was not judged
        by belief but by harmony. Every soul had to remember its name (<em>Ren</em>), nourish its essence (<em>Ka</em>),
        and pass through the twelve gates of the <em>Duat</em> before becoming <em>Akh</em>, radiant eternal light.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this three-part journey, we follow the soul’s path from ritual preservation and mummification, through the
        Duat’s trials, guardians, passwords, and transformations, to the Weighing of the Heart and the birth of the
        immortal Akh. What the Egyptians called resurrection, the Gnostics would later recognise as <em>gnosis</em>,
        the remembrance of the divine identity concealed within.
