      <p>
        <strong>Gnostic Christianity</strong> unveils a cosmos born of error, ruled by lesser powers,
        and redeemed through remembrance. Salvation is not granted by belief but revealed through
        <em>gnosis</em>, the awakening of the divine spark concealed within humanity.
      </p>

      <p>
        This series follows Sophia’s fall, the birth of the false creator, and the descent of the
        Revealer. Christ appears not as ruler but as mirror, calling the soul to remember its origin
        beyond the veil of matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        These pages trace the return to the Pleroma — the realm of fullness — where the soul awakens
        from forgetfulness and recognises its true light once more.
