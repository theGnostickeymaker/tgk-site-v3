      <p>
        <strong>Season I of The Afterlife Episodes</strong> explores the sacred maps of death, judgement,
        transformation, and return preserved across the world’s great mystical traditions.
        Each page reveals a different cosmology, yet all speak to the same truth:
        death is not annihilation, but passage.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the Gnostic unveiling of the false cosmos, to the Sufi journey of the heart,
        to the Kabbalistic ascent of the soul, and the Buddhist bardos of illumination,
        through to the Egyptian Duat and the Mesoamerican temples of time, these teachings
        restore what the modern world has forgotten — that all spirits return to the Source
        from which they came.
