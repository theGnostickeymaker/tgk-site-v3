      <p>
        <strong>Sufi Islam</strong> reveals the inner, contemplative heart of Islam: the path of love, remembrance, 
        and the unveiling of the Real. Through <em>dhikr</em>, devotion dissolves illusion; through longing, the soul 
        is refined; through presence, the veil thins.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Season explores the stations and states of the traveller, the purification of the heart, the mysteries 
        of <em>fanā’</em> (the annihilation of the false self), and <em>baqā’</em> (abiding in divine reality). It is a map 
        of return to the Beloved, not through doctrine, but through direct experience.
