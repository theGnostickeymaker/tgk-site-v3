    </summary>

    <p>
      <strong>The Great Return</strong> is a threefold journey into the deepest questions of
      the soul. It unites the world’s afterlife traditions, the inner temple teachings of
      transformation, and the sacred inquiry into what it means to be human.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Season 1, The Afterlife Scrolls</strong>, maps the passages of death and rebirth
      found across the world’s mystical traditions. It traces the soul’s movement through
      judgement, transformation and remembrance, revealing the many ways cultures have
      understood the return beyond the veil.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Season 2, Temple of the Afterlife</strong>, turns inward to the subtle body, the
      initiatory gates, and the esoteric teachings that guide the traveller through the hidden
      architecture of consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Season 3, The Human Question</strong>, asks how the sacred traditions define the
      human being, examining the soul’s origin, purpose and dignity within the wider struggle
      for meaning and spiritual sovereignty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across all three seasons, The Great Return teaches that death is not an ending but a
      passage, that remembrance is a discipline, and that the soul carries a destiny older than
      any world it enters.
