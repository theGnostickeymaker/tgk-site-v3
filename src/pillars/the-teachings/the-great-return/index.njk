      <p>
        <strong>The Great Return</strong> is a threefold journey into the deepest questions of the soul.  
        It brings together the world’s afterlife traditions, the inner temple teachings of transformation,  
        and the sacred inquiry into what it means to be human.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Season 1, The Afterlife Scrolls</strong>, follows the soul’s movement through judgement,  
        transformation and remembrance, preserving the diverse ways the world’s mystical traditions  
        understand the return beyond the veil.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Season 2, Temple of the Afterlife</strong>, turns inward, exploring the subtle body,  
        the initiatory gates, and the esoteric architectures through which consciousness journeys  
        in life and after death.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Season 3, The Human Question</strong>, examines how the sacred traditions define  
        the human being, tracing the soul’s origin, purpose and dignity within the wider search  
        for meaning and spiritual sovereignty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Across all three Seasons, The Great Return teaches that death is a passage rather than an end,  
        that remembrance is a discipline, and that the soul carries a destiny older than any world  
        into which it incarnates.
