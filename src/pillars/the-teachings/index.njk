  </summary>
  <p>
    <strong>The Afterlife Series</strong> explores the sacred maps of death and return found in
    the worldâ€™s great mystical traditions. Each scroll traces the soulâ€™s journey through
    judgement, transformation and remembrance.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the Gnostic revelations of early Christianity to the Sufi, Kabbalistic, Buddhist,
    Egyptian and Mesoamerican visions of the beyond, these teachings reveal that death is
    not an ending but a passage â€“ a return to the Source from which all spirits arise.
