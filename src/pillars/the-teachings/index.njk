        <strong>The Afterlife Series</strong> explores the sacred maps of death and return found in
        the world’s great mystical traditions. Each page traces the soul’s journey through
        judgement, transformation and remembrance.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the Gnostic revelations of early Christianity to the Sufi, Kabbalistic, Buddhist,
        Egyptian and Mesoamerican visions of the beyond, these teachings reveal that death is
        not an ending but a passage – a return to the Source from which all spirits arise.
