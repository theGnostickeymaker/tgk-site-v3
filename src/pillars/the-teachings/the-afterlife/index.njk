  <p>
    The <strong>Afterlife Scrolls</strong> gather humanityâ€™s most enduring maps of what awaits beyond death.
    From the weighing of the heart in ancient Egypt, to the Tibetan passage through bardos, to the Gnostic ascent past the Archons,
    each teaching preserves a thread of remembrance. These scrolls are not fantasy tales but living blueprints, guiding initiates through realms of shadow and light, judgment and mercy, dissolution and return.
  </p>
  <p>
    To study the afterlife is to study life itself: how we are remembered, how justice is weighed,
    and how liberation is won. These traditions, though diverse in symbol and language, share a single
    recognition â€” that death is not an end but a crossing.
