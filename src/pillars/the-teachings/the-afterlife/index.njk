      <p>
        <strong>The Afterlife Series</strong> gathers scrolls that explore how cultures across
        time have mapped what lies beyond death. From Egyptian Duat to Buddhist Bardos, from
        Sufi visions to Gnostic cosmologies, these teachings reveal the many ways humanity has
        understood the passage of the soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each scroll is structured for seekers: with introductions, glossaries, and reflections
        to guide deeper study. Some traditions speak of liberation, others of judgement or
        return — but all point toward mysteries that shape how we live, die, and remember.
