    <span>&ldquo;Samsāra has no beginning that can be seen.&rdquo;</span>
    <cite> Saṃyutta Nikāya</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In Buddhist cosmology, reality is not linear. It spirals.</p>
  <p>This spiral is called <strong>Samsāra, </strong>the Wheel of Becoming, where beings move through lifetimes across six realms: god, demigod, human, animal, hungry ghost, and hell-being. Each realm is both literal and symbolic: places of rebirth, but also <em>states of mind</em> we drift through daily.</p>
  <p>The wheel spins because of <strong>karma, </strong>intentional actions and <strong>taṇhā,</strong> craving. Like gravity, karma pulls. Like fire, it burns. We chase, we cling, we become and so we are reborn.</p>
  <p>But this cycle is not eternal law, it is <em>conditioned</em>. What is conditioned can be <strong>unconditioned</strong>. The Buddha did not teach how to make a better ride on the wheel, he taught how to <em>step off</em> it.</p>
  <p>Theravāda emphasises anattā (no-self), viewing rebirth as a process without a permanent soul, while Mahāyāna&rsquo;s Pure Land tradition trusts in Amitābha Buddha&rsquo;s vow to guide devotees to a rebirth-free paradise. Vajrayāna, our focus in part III, illuminates the bardo&rsquo;s visionary path.</p>
  <p>For the Gnostic seeker, this teaching resonates: the world is not a blessing, but a trap of recurrence. Liberation is not ascension through the realms, but <strong>departure from the cycle itself</strong>.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>Karma</strong> is not fate. It is not divine punishment, nor cosmic reward.  
  In the Buddha&rsquo;s words: karma is <em>intention</em>.</p>

  <p>Every thought, word, and action plants a seed, shaping the conditions that follow. This is not metaphysics, it is the observable architecture of becoming.</p>

  <p>Like a machine, karma generates momentum. The wheel turns not by accident, but because we fuel it: with craving, resistance, grasping, fear.</p>

  <p>But karma is not static. Its engine can be stopped. In fact, that&rsquo;s the aim of the Buddhist path, to end the cycle by ending the fuel. To act <em>without clinging</em>. To do <em>without becoming</em>.</p>

  <p>For Gnostic seekers, this resembles the Archonic system, a spiritual mechanism built on false desire and illusion. Karma is the script of the false world. Liberation requires stepping beyond the script entirely.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>In Buddhist cosmology, the six realms of existence are often described as literal rebirths, but they are also <strong>mirrors of mind</strong>. You do not need to die to visit them. You pass through them daily.</p>

  <p>They are:</p>
  <ul class="list-emoji">
    <li><strong>Deva (God) Realm</strong> &mdash; pleasure, distraction, spiritual pride</li>
    <li><strong>Asura (Demigod) Realm</strong> &mdash; jealousy, egoic striving, competition</li>
    <li><strong>Human Realm</strong> &mdash; balance of joy and suffering, potential for awakening</li>
    <li><strong>Animal Realm</strong> &mdash; instinct, fear, survival, ignorance</li>
    <li><strong>Hungry Ghost Realm</strong> &mdash; addiction, craving, insatiable desire</li>
    <li><strong>Hell Realm</strong> &mdash; rage, agony, torment, hatred</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These are not punishments, they are <em>reflections</em>. Each realm reveals a dominant state of consciousness. Each one is a teaching. And every moment is a crossroads: which realm are you in?</p>

  <p>The Buddha taught that the human realm is the rarest, because it balances <strong>clarity and suffering</strong>. It offers the best chance for awakening. Gnostics would call it the midpoint of the labyrinth, where the false light and true light are both visible.</p>

  <p>To understand the realms is to understand the self. To pass through them consciously is to begin breaking the wheel.</p>

    <span>&ldquo;When this is, that is. From the arising of this, that arises.&rdquo;</span>
    <cite> The Buddha, on Dependent Origination</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Buddha taught that suffering is not random, it is structured.  
  A patterned chain. A recursive loop.</p>

  <p>This structure is called <strong>Paṭicca-Samuppāda, </strong> Dependent Origination.  
  It describes the twelve interlinked links of becoming, each giving rise to the next:</p>

  <ol class="list-emoji">
    <li><strong>Ignorance (avijjā)</strong> &mdash; Not knowing the true nature of reality. The primal blindness to impermanence, non-self, and the nature of suffering. It is the root illusion that sets the cycle in motion.</li>
  <li><strong>Volitional Formations (saṅkhāra)</strong> &mdash; Conditioned impulses or karmic actions, shaped by ignorance. These are the seeds, mental, verbal, physical, that shape future experiences.</li>
  <li><strong>Consciousness (viññāṇa)</strong> &mdash; Awareness conditioned by past karma. This is not pure awareness, but a specific stream of perception tied to karmic tendencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Name and Form (nāma-rūpa)</strong> &mdash; The arising of body and mind: sensation, perception, thought, identity. Consciousness crystallises into a new being.</li>
  <li><strong>Six Sense Spheres (saḷāyatana)</strong> &mdash; The development of the five senses and the mind as a sixth. The apparatus of perception is re-established.</li>
  <li><strong>Contact (phassa)</strong> &mdash; When the senses meet objects, contact arises, a spark between subject and object.</li>
  <li><strong>Feeling (vedanā)</strong> &mdash; From contact arises feeling: pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. This is the raw experience of sensation.</li>
  <li><strong>Craving (taṇhā)</strong> &mdash; Feeling gives rise to desire, the thirst to possess, to avoid, or to repeat. The mind begins to reach.</li>
  <li><strong>Clinging (upādāna)</strong> &mdash; Craving intensifies into attachment. The mind grabs onto ideas, identities, objects, relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Becoming (bhava)</strong> &mdash; Clinging sets into motion the process of becoming, the karmic momentum that conditions the next existence.</li>
  <li><strong>Birth (jāti)</strong> &mdash; The arising of a new life, form, or identity, not only literal birth, but any moment we "become" something again.</li>
  <li><strong>Decay and Death (jarāmaraṇa)</strong> &mdash; Every arising ends. With birth comes aging, dissolution, and death, followed by grief, lamentation, and the wheel beginning again.</li>
</ol>

  <p>This is the engine of Samsāra, a loop that creates identity, rebirth, and suffering.  
  But it is not eternal. Each link is <em>conditional</em>.  
  If you break one link, the chain <strong>stops</strong>.</p>

  <p>Gnostic teachings echo this. The soul, caught in the Archons&rsquo; illusions, descends through layers of ignorance and craving.  
  But at any gate, it can <strong>remember</strong>. It can turn back.</p>

  <p>To see the links is to weaken them.  
  To see the wheel is to begin stepping off.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>All things begin in forgetting.</p>

  <p>In Buddhism, the first link of the cycle of rebirth is <strong>avijjā, </strong>ignorance.  
  Not mere lack of knowledge, but the <em>primordial blindness</em> to the truth of impermanence, non-self, and suffering.</p>

  <p>It is the ignorance that believes in a fixed &ldquo;I,&rdquo; that grasps for permanence in the impermanent,  
  that mistakes craving for joy and the world for a home. It is this illusion that births karma, and the entire wheel turns from there.</p>

  <p>The Gnostic vision mirrors this:  
  we are born not in innocence, but in amnesia. The soul forgets its origin in the Pleroma.  
  Memory fades. The divine spark is buried. The veil falls.</p>

  <p>This is the <strong>Great Forgetting, </strong>and every birth is a repetition of it.</p>

    live in the world without attachment.&rdquo;</span>
    <cite> Dhammapada 49</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In Buddhist cosmology, existence spans six realms, each shaped by karma, each offering a distorted mirror of the mind. These realms are:</p>

  <ol class="list-emoji">
    <li><strong>Deva (God) Realm</strong> &mdash;a realm of bliss and beauty, but sedated by spiritual pride and complacency</li>
    <li><strong>Asura (Demi-God) Realm</strong> &mdash; dominated by jealousy, rivalry, and restless striving</li>
    <li><strong>Human Realm</strong> &mdash; balanced between pleasure and suffering, it offers the clearest chance for awakening</li>
    <li><strong>Animal Realm</strong> &mdash; ruled by instinct, ignorance, and fear</li>
    <li><strong>Preta (Hungry Ghost) Realm</strong> &mdash; defined by insatiable craving and emotional famine</li>
    <li><strong>Naraka (Hell) Realm</strong> &mdash; tormented by rage, hatred, and anguish</li>
  </ol>

  <p>These are not just post-mortem destinations, they are <strong>states of consciousness</strong> that rise and fall within a single day, or a single life.  
  One moment in divine ease, the next in ghost-like hunger. This is the inner wheel.</p>

  <p>To see the realms as mirrors is to begin waking. What we experience &ldquo;out there&rdquo; is often the echo of what moves within.  
  For the Gnostic, this understanding deepens: each realm is not just psychological, but <em>symbolic architecture,</em> astral projections shaped by karma, ignorance, and archonic interference.</p>

  <p>The great task is not to escape upward, but to pierce the illusion of all realms. Even heaven is samsāra. Even pleasure binds.</p>

    <span>&ldquo;Not addicted to indulgence,

    <cite> The Buddha, on the Middle Way</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After abandoning a life of princely luxury, the Buddha turned to extreme asceticism, fasting, silence, self-punishment. But he found no peace. His body collapsed. His mind frayed.</p>

  <p>Then came the revelation: <strong>neither indulgence nor denial</strong> liberate the soul. Both are traps. The path lies in the middle, fierce in discipline, yet free from violence.</p>

  <p>This is the <strong>Middle Way</strong>: a razor&rsquo;s edge. It does not reject desire with hatred, nor embrace it with craving. It meets the fire <em>without burning</em>.</p>

  <p>For the Gnostic, this teaching resonates as a method of <em>gnosis-in-the-world</em>: one must walk awake in a realm of illusion without falling for its temptations, nor fleeing into spiritual bypassing. The world must be met and seen through, not denied or decorated.</p>

  <p>Balance is not softness, it is <strong>fire under control</strong>. Discipline with compassion. Awareness that does not flinch.</p>

  <p>In Buddhist teaching, death is not the end. It is a moment of tremendous significance, a <strong>gateway</strong> where the illusions of solidity, self, and control dissolve.</p>

  <p>At death, the body collapses, but the stream of consciousness does not vanish. It moves. It carries forward the imprints of karma, memories, tendencies, unfinished desires, into the space between lives.</p>

  <p>This is the entry into the <strong>Bardo</strong>: the in-between state. A place of dreams, visions, revelations, and distortions, all shaped by the mind&rsquo;s habits.</p>

  <p>For the Gnostic, this threshold echoes the moment of the soul&rsquo;s <em>separation from the counterfeit body,</em> a peeling away from the illusion of form to face the mirror of truth.</p>

  <p>To die consciously is to pass through this gate with awareness. Not to escape fear, but to meet it without clinging.</p>

  <p>In the Bardo, there is no body, only <strong>mind</strong>. But the mind is not empty. It creates.</p>

  <p>Everything repressed, ignored, denied, or craved begins to arise in dream-like form.  
  Frightening visions. Beautiful illusions. Longing. Guilt. Bliss. Regret.</p>

  <p>This is not punishment, it is <em>reflection</em>.  
  The Bardo becomes a <strong>mirror of the mind</strong>, a psychic theatre where karmic imprints play out in full color.</p>

  <p>If the soul panics, it grasps at these visions and falls into a new rebirth.  
  If the soul remains calm and aware, it recognises these appearances as <em>mind-made,</em> and may transcend them.</p>

  <p>Gnostic parallels are profound. The Archons project illusions to trap the soul. But those illusions have no power once seen for what they are: shadows of the self. The awakened mind does not fight the dream, it <strong>sees through it</strong>.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>On the second week in the Bardo, <strong>figures of dazzling light and terrible form</strong> begin to appear.</p>

  <p>Some radiate compassion and peace, these are the <em>peaceful deities</em>. Others roar in flame and shadow, these are the <em>wrathful deities</em>. Both are aspects of the same truth.</p>

  <p>They are not gods in the Western sense. They are <strong>projections of the soul&rsquo;s mind</strong>, infused with karmic charge. If one meets them with terror or desire, the soul recoils, and spirals into rebirth. But if one sees through the projection, the deity becomes a portal of release.</p>

  <p>To the Gnostic, these figures echo the Archons and Aeons, symbolic powers that appear to the soul at threshold moments. The Archons seek to bind; the Aeons to awaken. But both are masks. Only the <strong>unconditioned spark</strong> beneath them is real.</p>

  <p>All forms in the Bardo, light or shadow, are dreams. Recognition, not worship or resistance, is the way through.</p>

  <p>There is no judge in the Bardo. No heavenly court. No cosmic scale.  
  Only <strong>reflection</strong>.</p>

  <p>Consciousness sees the echoes of every deed, word, and thought, not as punishment, but as vibration.</p>
  <p>Everything unresolved rises.  
  Everything clung to clings back.</p>

  <p>This moment has been called &ldquo;the weighing of the heart.&rdquo;  
  But it is not your heart being weighed.  
  It is you, <em>weighing your own soul</em>.</p>

  <p>For the Gnostic, this is the encounter with the mirror of Sophia, where false selves burn away, and only what is real remains.  
  The Archons may have asked questions.  
  But now, you are both question and answer.</p>

  <p>In the deepest silence of the Bardo, all forms fall away.</p>

  <p>No more deities. No more mirrors. No more fear. Only <strong>radiance,</strong> unbounded, silent, infinite.</p>

  <p>This is the <strong>Clear Light</strong>. It is not a tunnel. Not a god. It is your original awareness, before thought and form.</p>

  <p>To recognise it is liberation. To recoil from it is rebirth.</p>

  <p>Most beings turn away. The Light is too vast, too formless, too pure. The ego clings to story. To shape. To sensation. And so, the wheel turns again.</p>

  <p>But the awakened one does not fear the Light. They <em>become</em> it.</p>

  <p>For the Gnostic, this is the moment the divine spark remembers itself,not as a self, but as the Light behind all selves.</p>
