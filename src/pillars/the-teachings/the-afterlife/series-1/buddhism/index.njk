      <p>
        <strong>Buddhism</strong> teaches the way beyond suffering and rebirth ‚Äî through
        insight, compassion, and awakening to the nature of mind. In this three-part journey,
        we move from the cosmic Wheel and its six realms, through the Bodhisattva‚Äôs heart,
        to the Diamond Path of VajrayƒÅna and the Clear Light of Liberation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scroll cycle reveals how death, illusion, and rebirth mirror the mind‚Äôs own
        play ‚Äî and how liberation begins in the present moment, through knowing the nature
        of awareness itself.
