      <p>
        <strong>Gnostic Christianity</strong> unveils a universe born of error, ruled by false powers,
        and redeemed through knowledge. It is not faith that saves, but <em>gnosis</em> ‚Äî the awakening
        of the divine spark within humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this series, we follow Sophia‚Äôs fall and Christ‚Äôs revelation ‚Äî tracing how light became trapped
        in matter, and how the Redeemer descends not to rule, but to remind us of our forgotten origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        These scrolls reveal how every soul carries within it the memory of the Pleroma ‚Äî and how the return
        begins the moment the illusion of separation ends.
