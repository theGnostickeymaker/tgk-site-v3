  <p>
    <strong>Gnostic Christianity</strong> opens Series 1 with the radical streams of the early Church 
    that sought hidden knowledge (<em>gnosis</em>) of the soul’s true home. These scrolls explore 
    how Gnostic teachers understood creation, the prison of matter, and the path of return 
    through Christ as revealer rather than ruler.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here the Afterlife is not simply judgement or paradise — but a journey of awakening, where 
    the soul must remember its origin and overcome the Archons who bind it. This cycle sets the 
    tone for the Afterlife Series, revealing Christianity’s suppressed mystical maps of liberation.
