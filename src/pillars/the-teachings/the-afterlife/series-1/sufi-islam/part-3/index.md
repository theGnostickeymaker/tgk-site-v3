# 🎨 Creative Prompt
creativePrompt:
  text: "Write a short poem or reflection titled <strong>“The Drop and the Ocean.”</strong> Imagine your soul dissolving into the Beloved’s light — what falls away, what radiance remains? What did you fear to lose, and what did you find instead? Let your words be both veil and unveiling."
  sharePrompt: "Share your piece with <strong>#TheGnosticKey</strong> and tag <strong>@thegnostickey</strong> — your drop may ripple across another ocean."

# 🗣 Discussion Prompt
discussion:
  promptTitle: "When Longing Becomes a Flame"
  intro: "You’ve crossed silence and surrender, touched the edges of presence — and now, the ache itself begins to burn. The flame is not your enemy. It is the call."
  question: "What longing scares you the most — and what if it is the Beloved calling you to surrender today?"
  points:
    - "What ache has shaped your path more than any answer?"
    - "Is there a part of you that fears being seen — even by the Divine?"
    - "What would it mean to surrender not just your mind, but your longing itself?"

  <p>After longing, remembrance, and unveiling, there is one final gate: the surrender of the &ldquo;I.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This is <strong>fanā&lsquo;</strong>, the ego&lsquo;s annihilation in Divine presence.</p>

  <p>It is not death of the soul. It is death of separation, of pride, of all the masks that whisper &ldquo;mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The mystic passes through this gate not by force, but by melting: like a moth dissolving into flame, like a river surrendering to the sea.</p>

    &ldquo;I am He whom I love, and He whom I love is I. We are two souls dwelling in one body.&rdquo;<br>

  <p>Here, lover and Beloved are no longer two. Only Love remains.</p>

  <p>In Sufi cosmology, the soul&lsquo;s afterlife journey mirrors the Prophet&lsquo;s <em>Miʿrāj</em>, not through space, but unveiling. Each realm peels back illusion, asking the soul to surrender deeper layers of self.</p>

  <ul class="list-emoji">
    <li><strong>Barzakh (The Veil)</strong>, The Mirror Realm.<br>
      You meet your own soul-architecture. What you sowed, you now face.<br>

    <li><strong>Malakūt (The Harmonious)</strong>, The Angelic Realm.<br>

  <p>Abiding in God is not static. It is a <strong>dance</strong>, an endless, unfolding, radiant motion.</p>

  <p>The soul, now dissolved and abiding, becomes part of the Divine&lsquo;s eternal creativity: ever-renewing, ever-revealing, ever-beautiful.</p>

<section class="section-block">
  <h2 class="section-heading">🧘 Practicing Sufi Remembrance Today</h2>

  <p>Sufism is not a theory, it&lsquo;s a living flame. Like gnosis, it must be practiced to be known. Below are three core exercises to bring the Sufi path alive within you, wherever you are.</p>

  <h4 class="section-subheading">1. Dhikr with the Divine Name</h4>
  <p>Choose a Divine Name, such as <strong>Ar-Rahmān (The Compassionate)</strong> or <strong>Al-Nūr (The Light)</strong>. Sit in silence. Breathe gently. Repeat the Name aloud or inwardly with each breath for 5–10 minutes daily. Let the Name shape your heart into remembrance.</p>

  <h4 class="section-subheading">2. Journaling Longing</h4>
  <p>Once per week, write freely about a moment of longing, grief, or absence in your life. Ask: <em>&ldquo;What if this ache is the Beloved in disguise?&rdquo;</em> Don't analyze. Let the ink be your mirror.</p>

  <h4 class="section-subheading">3. Inner Spiral Meditation</h4>
  <p>If you cannot whirl physically, whirl inwardly. Sit comfortably. Visualize yourself spiraling slowly toward the Divine Center. With each breath, drop a layer of ego. Whisper inwardly: <em>&ldquo;You are the center. I remember.&rdquo;</em></p>

  <hr class="divider-sigil" />

  <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Start a 21-day "Remembrance Log." Alternate practices daily. Record your insights, dreams, or shifts. At the end, ask: <em>&ldquo;Where is the Beloved now?&rdquo;</em></p>
