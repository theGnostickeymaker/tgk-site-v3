  <p>
    <strong>Sufi Islam</strong> continues Series 1 with teachings that see death not as an end, 
    but as a reunion. Drawing on Qur’anic imagery, mystical poetry, and the wisdom of saints, 
    these scrolls explore how Sufis mapped the passage of the soul and the unveiling of hidden worlds.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this tradition, the Afterlife is a journey of love and remembrance: the soul leaves the veil 
    of separation to return to the Source. The scrolls highlight stages of judgement and mercy, 
    visions of paradise, and the deeper teaching that <em>death itself is a lover’s meeting</em>.
