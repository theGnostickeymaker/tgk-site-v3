      <p>
        <strong>Kabbalah</strong> is the ancient mystical framework describing how the Infinite
        (<em>Ein Sof</em>) flows into creation through ten <strong>Sefirot</strong> — vessels of
        divine energy forming the <em>Tree of Life</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This series follows the soul’s descent into form, its purification through light, and its
        ascent back to <strong>Tiferet</strong>, where harmony between heaven and earth is restored.
        It is a map of emanation, return, and remembrance — a sacred geometry of the soul’s journey.
