      <p>
        <strong>Ancient Egyptian afterlife teachings</strong> reveal one of humanity’s oldest maps of the soul’s return.
        Through <em>Ma’at</em>, the cosmic law of truth and balance, the dead were not judged by belief — but by resonance.
        Every soul had to remember its name (<em>Ren</em>), nourish its essence (<em>Ka</em>), and pass the
        twelve gates of the <em>Duat</em> before becoming <em>Akh</em> — radiant, eternal light.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this three-part journey, we follow the soul’s path from mummification and ritual preservation,
        through the Duat’s trials and passwords, to the Weighing of the Heart and the birth of the immortal Akh.
        What the Egyptians called resurrection, the Gnostics would later call <em>gnosis</em> — remembering the divine within.
