      <p>
        <strong>Ancient Egyptian afterlife teachings</strong> reveal one of humanityâ€™s oldest maps of the soulâ€™s return.
        Through <em>Maâ€™at</em>, the cosmic law of truth and balance, the dead were not judged by belief â€” but by resonance.
        Every soul had to remember its name (<em>Ren</em>), nourish its essence (<em>Ka</em>), and pass the
        twelve gates of the <em>Duat</em> before becoming <em>Akh</em> â€” radiant, eternal light.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this three-part journey, we follow the soulâ€™s path from mummification and ritual preservation,
        through the Duatâ€™s trials and passwords, to the Weighing of the Heart and the birth of the immortal Akh.
        What the Egyptians called resurrection, the Gnostics would later call <em>gnosis</em> â€” remembering the divine within.
