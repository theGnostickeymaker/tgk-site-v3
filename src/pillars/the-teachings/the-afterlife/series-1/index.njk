  <p>
    <strong>Series 1</strong> opens the Afterlife journey with foundational maps of the beyond. 
    These scrolls trace how ancient and mystical traditions — from Gnostic Christianity and 
    Sufi Islam, to Buddhism, Kabbalah, and Ancient Egypt — charted the fate of the soul after death.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each episode is designed as a guide: complete with glossaries, reflections, and symbolic 
    keys to help seekers navigate these cosmologies. This first series establishes the ground, 
    showing how diverse cultures envisioned judgement, liberation, and return.
