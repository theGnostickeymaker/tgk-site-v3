  <p>
    <strong>Series 1</strong> begins the descent into the great mysteries. These scrolls reveal how traditions across time, from the Gnostic ascent past cosmic rulers, to Sufi annihilation in the Divine, to the Kabbalistic tree of return, imagined the soulâ€™s passage after death.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are the foundations: mythic geographies, trials of judgement, and teachings of liberation. Together they form the first mirror of remembrance, guiding seekers to face what lies beyond the veil with courage and insight.
