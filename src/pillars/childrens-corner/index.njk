    <p>
      <strong>Childrenâ€™s Corner</strong> is the storytelling pillar of The Gnostic Key â€”
      a place for young seekers to explore gentle parables, spiritual fables, and
      mythic adventures. Here teachings are simplified into tales that open the heart
      and spark the imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designed to be kind and accessible, these stories offer children a way to
      encounter mystery and meaning in forms they can hold. The Corner is a safe,
      luminous space where memory and myth meet play and wonder.
