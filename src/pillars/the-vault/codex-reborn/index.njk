    <p>
    <strong>Codex Reborn</strong> forms part of <strong>The Vault</strong> â€” the archival pillar of
    <em>The Gnostic Key</em> â€” where sacred, forbidden, and forgotten texts are preserved for study
    and remembrance. It gathers the <strong>Gnostic Gospels</strong> recovered from Nag Hammadi and
    other hidden libraries, curated for modern seekers of truth.
    </p>

    <p>
      These scrolls, once buried in sand or condemned by empire, are restored within the
      <strong>Vault of remembrance</strong>. Each text reveals fragments of the same celestial map â€”
      unveiling Sophiaâ€™s fall, the false creator, and the awakening of the soulâ€™s divine spark.
    </p>

    <p>
      The collection includes the <em>Apocryphon of John</em>, the <em>Gospel of Thomas</em>,
      the <em>Gospel of Truth</em>, and <em>Pistis Sophia</em> â€” each freely accessible,
      formatted for clarity, and interlinked with teachings throughout
      <strong>The Afterlife Series</strong> and other pillars of <em>The Gnostic Key</em>.
