      <p>
        <strong>Codex Reborn</strong> forms part of <strong>The Vault</strong> â€” the archival pillar of
        <em>The Gnostic Key</em> â€” where sacred, forbidden, and forgotten texts are preserved for study
        and remembrance. It gathers the <strong>Gnostic Gospels</strong> recovered from Nag Hammadi and
        other hidden libraries, curated for modern seekers of truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        These pages, once buried in sand or condemned by empire, are restored within the
        <strong>Vault of Remembrance</strong>. Each text reveals fragments of the same celestial map â€”
        unveiling Sophiaâ€™s fall, the false creator, and the awakening of the soulâ€™s divine spark.
      </p>

      <p>
        The collection includes the <em>Apocryphon of John</em>, the <em>Gospel of Thomas</em>,
        the <em>Gospel of Truth</em>, and <em>Pistis Sophia</em> â€” each freely accessible,
        formatted for clarity, and interlinked with teachings throughout 
        <strong>The Afterlife Series</strong> and other pillars of <em>The Gnostic Key</em>.
