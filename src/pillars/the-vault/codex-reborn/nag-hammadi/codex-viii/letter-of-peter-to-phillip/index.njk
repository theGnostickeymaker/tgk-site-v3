    <p>
      The <strong>Letter of Peter to Philip</strong> (Codex VIII, 2) describes a secret apostolic dialogue
      on persecution, knowledge, and strength through the Light.  Peter writes to Philip, who
      joins the disciples on a mountain where the risen Christ appears in radiant form,
      instructing them on liberation from the powers of darkness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The work blends epistolary form and revelation dialogue â€” a bridge between scripture and vision,
      closing the cycle of Gnostic apostolic teachings preserved in the <strong>Nag Hammadi Library</strong>.
