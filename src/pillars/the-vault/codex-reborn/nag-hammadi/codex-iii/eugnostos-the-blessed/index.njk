    <h2>Eugnostos the Blessed</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Eugnostos the Blessed</strong> is a metaphysical treatise describing the divine structure of the universe.
      It reveals how the ineffable God emanates aeons of light and consciousness â€” self-replicating patterns of being.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text inspired the <em>Sophia of Jesus Christ</em>, reshaping its cosmology through direct revelation.
      Within it, we find the first systematic Gnostic cosmology â€” a theology of light, mind, and restoration.
