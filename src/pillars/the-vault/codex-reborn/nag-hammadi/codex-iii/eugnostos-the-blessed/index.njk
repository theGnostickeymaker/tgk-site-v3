    <h2>Eugnostos the Blessed</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Eugnostos the Blessed</strong> is a metaphysical treatise describing the
      divine hierarchy and emanations of the <em>Pleroma</em> — the boundless fullness of
      Godhead. It reveals how the ineffable Source emanates aeons of light and
      consciousness, forming the architecture of divine reality.

    <p>
      This text directly inspired <em>The Sophia of Jesus Christ</em>, recasting its
      cosmology through the lens of revelation and mind. Within its luminous geometry
      lies the first systematic Gnostic cosmology — a theology of light, order, and
      restoration.
