    <h2>The Gospel of the Egyptians</h2>

    {% block bookmark %}{% include "partials/bookmark.njk" %}{% endblock %}

    <p>
      The <strong>Gospel of the Egyptians</strong>, also known as the
      <em>Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit</em>, is a cosmic hymn that
      celebrates the emanations of divine light, the architecture of the Pleroma,
      and the mystery of the Trinity of Light. It invokes the ineffable Father,
      Mother, and Son as eternal expressions of consciousness.

    <p>
      Preserved in <strong>Codex III</strong> of the <em>Nag Hammadi Library</em>,
      this text blends myth, chant, and revelation into a radiant affirmation of
      divine unity. Its invocations of “<em>Eleleth</em>” and “<em>Oeae</em>”
      mark the descent and ascent of divine thought — the self-awareness of
      creation itself.
