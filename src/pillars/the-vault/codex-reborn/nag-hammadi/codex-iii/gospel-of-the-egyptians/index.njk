    <h2>The Gospel of the Egyptians</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Gospel of the Egyptians</strong>, also known as the <em>Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit</em>,
      is a cosmic hymn that describes the emanations of divine light, the structure of the Pleroma, and the
      mystery of the Trinity of Light. It invokes the ineffable Father, Mother, and Son as eternal manifestations
      of consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preserved in Codex III of the <strong>Nag Hammadi Library</strong>, this gospel blends myth, chant, and revelation
      into a profound expression of divine unity. Its invocations of “<em>Eleleth</em>” and “<em>Oeae</em>” mark
      the descent and ascent of divine thought — the self-awareness of creation.
