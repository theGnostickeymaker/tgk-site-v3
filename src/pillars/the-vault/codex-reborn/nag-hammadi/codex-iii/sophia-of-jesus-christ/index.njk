    <h2>The Sophia of Jesus Christ</h2>

    {% block bookmark %}{% include "partials/bookmark.njk" %}{% endblock %}

    <p>
      <strong>The Sophia of Jesus Christ</strong> presents a post-resurrection dialogue between the
      Savior and his disciples, unveiling the origin of creation, the hierarchy of the aeons,
      and the redemptive descent of <em>Sophia</em> — the divine Wisdom.
    </p>

    <p>
      This revelation expands upon <em>Eugnostos the Blessed</em>, integrating its cosmic vision
      with Christ’s voice as the Logos of Light. It portrays Wisdom and Word restoring the
      harmony of the Pleroma and awakening the spark of divine remembrance within humanity.
