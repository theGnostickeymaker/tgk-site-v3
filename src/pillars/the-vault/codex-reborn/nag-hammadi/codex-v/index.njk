      <strong>Codex II</strong> â€” the heart of the Nag Hammadi Library, preserving the

      <p>
        <strong>Codex II</strong> is the most complete and influential manuscript within the Nag Hammadi Library.
        It preserves the foundation texts of Gnostic spirituality â€” tracing the soulâ€™s origin in the
        <em>Pleroma</em>, its descent into matter, and the memory of return through divine knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        These writings form the spiritual architecture of <strong>Gnosis</strong>:
        the <em>Apocryphon of John</em> maps creation and the fall of Sophia;
        the <em>Gospel of Thomas</em> reveals the inner sayings of the Living Jesus;
        the <em>Gospel of Philip</em> teaches the mystery of union;
        and the <em>Hypostasis of the Archons</em> unveils the powers who rule the false heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, they chart the soulâ€™s awakening â€” from ignorance to illumination,
        from imprisonment to remembrance.
      </p>
