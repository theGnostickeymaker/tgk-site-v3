    <p>
      In this Gnostic apocalypse, Adam reveals to Seth the true history of creation, the rise of the false rulers,
      and the promise of liberation through the coming of the Spirit of Life.  
      It contrasts the false flood of water with the final flood of fire and knowledge that redeems the elect.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The Apocalypse of Adam</strong> stands as one of the most ancient and visionary works of the Nag Hammadi corpus â€”
      a testament of memory, prophecy, and resistance against the powers of forgetfulness.
