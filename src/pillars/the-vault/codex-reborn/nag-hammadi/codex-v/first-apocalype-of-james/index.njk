    <p>
      This revelation portrays Christ instructing James before his martyrdom, granting him sacred <strong>passwords</strong>
      and <strong>signs</strong> to pass safely through the heavens ruled by the Archons.  
      It is a manual of spiritual courage â€” a map for the soulâ€™s fearless return.
    </p>

    <p>
      Preserved in <strong>Nag Hammadi Codex V</strong>, it reveals the inner gnosis of liberation through remembrance, knowledge, and strength.
