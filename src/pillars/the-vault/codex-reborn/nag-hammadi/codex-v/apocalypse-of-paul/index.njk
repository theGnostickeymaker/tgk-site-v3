    <p>
      <em>The Apocalypse of Paul</em> (Nag Hammadi Codex V, 2) describes Paul’s ascent through the heavens guided by the Holy Spirit.  
      He passes through <strong>toll gates</strong> guarded by <strong>archons</strong> and <strong>interrogators</strong> who test the soul’s worth, 
      before receiving the hidden <strong>sign of freedom</strong> that grants liberation from their dominion.
    </p>

    <p>
      This revelation parallels the soul’s own passage through the realms of illusion — 
      exposing the <strong>machinery of judgment</strong> and affirming the soul’s divine origin beyond all powers of control.
