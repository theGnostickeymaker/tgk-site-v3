      <em>The Hypostasis of the Archons</em> (Codex II, 4) reveals the mythic foundation of Gnostic cosmology.  
      It recounts how the <strong>Archons</strong> — rulers of the material heavens — sought to dominate creation, 
      and how <strong>Sophia</strong>, through compassion, intervened to restore the divine image within humanity.
    </p>

    <p>
      This text reimagines <strong>Genesis</strong> as an occult battle between ignorance and remembrance,  
      exposing the <em>false creators</em> who shaped the visible world.  
      It is both a myth of resistance and a manual of awakening — the defiance of spirit against the machinery of matter.
