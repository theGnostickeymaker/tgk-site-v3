      <em>The Hypostasis of the Archons</em> (Codex II, 4) reveals the mythic foundation
      of Gnostic cosmology. It recounts how the <strong>Archons</strong> â€” rulers of the
      material heavens â€” sought to dominate creation, and how <strong>Sophia</strong>,
      through compassion, intervened to restore the divine image within humanity.

    <p>
      This text reimagines <strong>Genesis</strong> as an occult battle between ignorance
      and remembrance, exposing the <em>false creators</em> who shaped the visible world.  
      It is both a myth of resistance and a manual of awakening â€” the defiance of spirit
      against the machinery of matter.
