    <p>This text was discovered at <strong>Nag Hammadi</strong> in 1945, buried in the Egyptian desert. It contains 114 logia &mdash; &ldquo;sayings&rdquo; &mdash; attributed to <strong>Yeshua</strong> the Living One. There is no crucifixion, no resurrection &mdash; only the Word. What follows is a raw mirror of gnosis, rendered in sacred formatting for the digital temple of <strong>The Gnostic Key.</strong></p>

When the owners of the field come, they&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Give us back our field.&rsquo; They undress in their presence so as to let them have it and return their field to them. That&rsquo;s why I say, if the owner of a house knows that a thief is coming, they&rsquo;ll be on guard before the thief arrives and won&rsquo;t let the thief break into their house and steal their possessions. As for you, be on guard against the world. Prepare yourselves with great strength so the robbers can&rsquo;t find a way to come to you, for the trouble you expect will come. Let there be a person of understanding among you. When the crop ripened, he came quickly carrying a sickle and harvested it. Whoever has ears to hear should hear.&ldquo;</p>
