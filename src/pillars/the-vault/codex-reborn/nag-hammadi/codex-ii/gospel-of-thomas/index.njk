    <p>
      <em>The Gospel of Thomas</em> (Nag Hammadi Codex II, 2) is a collection of 114 sayings attributed to the Living Jesus.  
      It offers no narrative â€” only parables, riddles, and declarations that point inward toward direct self-knowledge.  
      Its central message: <strong>the Kingdom is within you and it is spread out upon the Earth, but men do not see it.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      These sayings preserve the voice of a mystical Christ who teaches awakening through remembrance, not belief â€”  
      a journey of recognition where the seeker and the Light become one.
