    <p>
      <em>The Gospel of Philip</em> (Nag Hammadi Codex II, 3) gathers brief reflections on
      initiation, illusion, and the sacred mystery called the <strong>Bridal Chamber</strong>.
      It teaches that true union arises when the divided aspects of being â€” male and female,
      matter and spirit â€” are reconciled in gnosis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike the canonical gospels, Philipâ€™s text speaks in symbols rather than story.
      It offers a sacramental vision of redemption through <strong>knowledge, love, and inner marriage</strong> â€” 
      the reunion of Christ and Sophia within the soul.
