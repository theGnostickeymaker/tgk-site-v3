      <p>
        Known also as the <em>Secret Book of John</em>, this foundational Gnostic revelation
        describes the emanations of the divine Mind, the fall of Sophia, and the creation of
        the false cosmos ruled by the Demiurge <strong>Yaldabaoth</strong>.
        Christâ€™s appearance to John unveils the truth of the soulâ€™s origin and its path back to the Pleroma.
      </p>
      <p>
        This text survives in multiple versions within the Nag Hammadi Library and became
        the cornerstone of Gnostic theology, blending mythic cosmology with the call to awakening.
