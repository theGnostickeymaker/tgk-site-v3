    <h2>Exegesis on the Soul</h2>
    <p>
      Text coming soon — preserved within <strong>The Vault</strong> for translation and study.  
      This closing hymn of <em>Codex II</em> tells of the soul’s fall into desire and her return
      through purification, memory, and the embrace of the divine Bridegroom.
