    <p>
      <em>The Second Treatise of the Great Seth</em> speaks in the voice of the
      <strong>Living Christ</strong> â€” not crucified, but laughing at the ignorance of the
      powers who believed they had subdued him.
      It celebrates the incorruptible union of those who remember their origin in the Light,
      the <em>unshakeable generation of truth</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A hymn of cosmic irony and sovereignty, this discourse transforms suffering into
      laughter â€” the knowing joy of divine remembrance beyond illusion.
