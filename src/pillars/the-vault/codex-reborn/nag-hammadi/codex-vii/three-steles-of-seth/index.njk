    <h2>The Three Steles of Seth</h2>

    <p>
      <em>The Three Steles of Seth</em> (Nag Hammadi Codex VII, 5) is a Gnostic hymn of ascent —
      the soul’s praise to the ineffable Father, uttered in the name of <strong>Seth the Perfect One</strong>.
      It expresses the stages of return from the world of matter into the fullness of divine light.
    </p>

    <p>
      This poetic work functions as both invocation and initiation, closing the Codex VII collection with
      the soul’s final thanksgiving — an ascent through remembrance, silence, and praise.
