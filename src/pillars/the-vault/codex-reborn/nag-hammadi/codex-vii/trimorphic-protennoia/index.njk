    <h2>Trimorphic Protennoia</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Trimorphic Protennoia</em> (Nag Hammadi Codex VII, 1) is the proclamation of the 
      <strong>Divine Voice before Creation</strong> — the Word (Logos) that speaks the universe into being.  
      It unfolds the threefold manifestation of the Protennoia: as <em>Voice, Speech, and Word</em>, 
      revealing the feminine current that shapes all reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      This text closes the Nag Hammadi Library’s revelation cycle — the descent of divine sound into form, 
      and its remembrance within the human soul.  
      Text coming soon — preserved within <strong>The Vault</strong> for study and translation.
