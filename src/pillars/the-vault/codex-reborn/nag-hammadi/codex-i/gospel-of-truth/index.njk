      <p>
        The <em>Gospel of Truth</em>, likely composed by <strong>Valentinus</strong> in the 2nd century CE,
        reads not as narrative but as a spiritual sermon on the awakening from ignorance into divine remembrance.
        It speaks of <em>the Word</em> coming into the world to heal the wound of forgetfulness and restore humanity to the Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discovered among the <strong>Nag Hammadi</strong> codices, this text belongs to the same current of revelation as
        the <em>Gospel of Thomas</em> and the <em>Apocryphon of John</em> â€” all teaching that salvation is
        remembrance, and that the Word of Truth awakens the spark within.
