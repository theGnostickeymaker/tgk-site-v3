    <p>
      This dialogue presents a post-resurrection teaching in which the Savior urges James and Peter to attain perfection through knowledge and suffering.  
      The text embodies the Gnostic vision that salvation is not escape from pain but illumination within it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Preserved in Codex I of the Nag Hammadi Library, the <em>Apocryphon of James</em> bridges canonical and esoteric Christianity â€” where faith meets gnosis in the heart of the seeker.
