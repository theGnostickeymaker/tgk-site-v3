    <p>
      This post-resurrection dialogue presents Christ urging James and Peter 
      to seek perfection through steadfastness, inner knowledge, and freedom 
      from fear. The text unites elements of early Christian teaching with 
      Gnostic insight, revealing that salvation is found not in escape but 
      in understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Preserved in <strong>Codex I</strong> of the Nag Hammadi Library, this work 
      bridges canonical faith and esoteric revelation, showing the seeker 
      a path of endurance shaped by remembrance of the inner light.
