    <p>
      This <strong>epistle to Rheginos</strong> speaks of the resurrection not as a future event but as an inner awakening that occurs
      when ignorance dies and knowledge is born.  
      It invites the reader to discover immortality through <strong>gnosis</strong> â€” the remembrance of oneâ€™s true nature.
    </p>

    <p>
      The text closes <em>Codex I</em> of the Nag Hammadi Library, uniting the revelations of <em>Valentinus</em> with a radiant vision of rebirth:
      life in spirit, victory over illusion, and eternal restoration in the Light.
