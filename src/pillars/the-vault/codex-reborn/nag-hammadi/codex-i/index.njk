      <p>
        <strong>Codex I</strong> of the Nag Hammadi Library, also known as the <em>Jung Codex</em>, was among the first to be discovered. 
        It includes the <em>Gospel of Truth</em> â€” a poetic reflection on self-knowledge and the Fatherâ€™s embrace â€” 
        as well as the <em>Tripartite Tractate</em> and <em>Treatise on the Resurrection</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These writings reveal the central Valentinian vision: that ignorance is the true exile, 
        and remembrance the act of redemption. Within these pages the seeker learns that to know oneself 
        is to return to the Source.
