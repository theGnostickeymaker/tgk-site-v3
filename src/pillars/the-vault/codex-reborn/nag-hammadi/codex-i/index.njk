      <p>
        <strong>Codex I</strong> of the Nag Hammadi Library, also called the 
        <em>Jung Codex</em>, was among the earliest manuscripts uncovered 
        near the cliffs of Jabal al-Tarif. It preserves the 
        <em>Gospel of Truth</em> — a luminous reflection attributed to the 
        Valentinian school — alongside the <em>Tripartite Tractate</em>, 
        <em>Treatise on the Resurrection</em>, and other foundational works.
      </p>

      <p>
        These writings express a central theme of Gnostic thought, that 
        ignorance is exile and remembrance the act of salvation. To awaken 
        to one’s origin is to return to the Source.
