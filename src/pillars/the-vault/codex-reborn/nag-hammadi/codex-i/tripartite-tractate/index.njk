    <p>
      <strong>The Tripartite Tractate</strong> is one of the most comprehensive Gnostic cosmologies preserved from antiquity.
      It describes the outflow of the <em>Pleroma</em>, the fall into multiplicity, and the gradual redemption of the cosmos.
      The title ‚ÄúTripartite‚Äù reflects its threefold pattern: <em>Emanation, Fall, and Restoration</em> ‚Äî the divine rhythm of existence.
    </p>

    <p>
      This text serves as a synthesis of Valentinian theology, merging metaphysics, psychology, and eschatology into one sweeping vision of return to the Father of Truth.
      Within it lies the full cycle of creation: unity lost, ignorance born, and light restored.
