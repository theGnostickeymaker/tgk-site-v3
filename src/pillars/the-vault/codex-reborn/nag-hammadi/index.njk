      <p>
        The <strong>Nag Hammadi Library</strong> forms the heart of the <strong>Codex Reborn</strong> 
        archive within <strong>The Vault</strong>. Thirteen Coptic codices were unearthed near 
        Nag Hammadi in 1945, preserving over fifty treatises that reveal the earliest 
        Christian mysticism and the hidden knowledge of the soul.

      <p>
        These manuscripts record the dramas of Sophia, the creation of the false cosmos, the 
        descent of the revealer, and the soul’s passage through the powers. Here you will find 
        foundational texts such as the <em>Gospel of Thomas</em>, the <em>Apocryphon of John</em>, 
        and the <em>Gospel of the Egyptians</em> — restored, formatted, and preserved for seekers 
        within the Vault of Remembrance.
