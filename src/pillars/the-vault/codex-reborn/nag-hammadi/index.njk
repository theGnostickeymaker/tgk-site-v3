      <p>
        In December 1945, near the town of <strong>Nag Hammadi</strong> in Upper Egypt, thirteen papyrus codices were unearthed.
        These manuscripts, sealed in clay jars, contained the most complete collection of <em>Gnostic texts</em> ever discovered â€”
        over fifty treatises that illuminate the secret teachings of Christ, Sophia, and the Divine Mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        The writings include <strong>The Gospel of Thomas</strong>, <strong>The Apocryphon of John</strong>,
        <strong>The Gospel of Truth</strong>, and <strong>Pistis Sophia</strong>.
        Together, they form the heart of the <em>Gnostic revelation</em> â€” a spiritual map of the soulâ€™s fall and redemption.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each codex has been restored and formatted within <strong>The Vault</strong> for study and preservation.
        Follow the links below to explore the texts by codex.
