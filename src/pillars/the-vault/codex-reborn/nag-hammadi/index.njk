      <p>
        This collection gathers the core Gnostic writings discovered in 1945 near the Egyptian town of <strong>Nag Hammadi</strong> â€” 
        thirteen leather-bound codices containing fifty-two tractates of mystical Christianity. 
        Within these pages are the <em>Apocryphon of John</em>, the <em>Gospel of Thomas</em>, the <em>Gospel of Truth</em>, 
        and many other revelations once buried by orthodoxy.
      </p>
      <p>
        These writings unveil the story of <strong>Sophiaâ€™s descent</strong>, the creation of the false cosmos, 
        and the soulâ€™s call to remembrance and return to the Light. 
        Each scroll is formatted for study and cross-linked across <strong>The Teachings</strong> 
        so you can trace the living thread between <em>scripture, symbolism, and practice.</em>
      </p>
