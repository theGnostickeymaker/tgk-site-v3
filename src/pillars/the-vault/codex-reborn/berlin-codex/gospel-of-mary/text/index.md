      <em>The Gospel of Mary</em> survives only in part — its first six pages are missing.
      What remains offers a dialogue between the risen Christ and <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong>,
      revealing the soul’s ascent and the illusion of sin. It stands as one of the earliest
      Christian writings to center <strong>Mary</strong> as a visionary teacher of gnosis.
