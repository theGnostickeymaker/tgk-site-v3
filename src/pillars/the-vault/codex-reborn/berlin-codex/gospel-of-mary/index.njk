      <p>
        The <strong>Gospel of Mary</strong> is found in the 
        <em>Berlin Gnostic Codex (Papyrus Berolinensis 8502)</em>, a fourth–fifth century Coptic manuscript 
        discovered near <strong>Akhmim</strong> in Upper Egypt and purchased in 1896 by 
        <strong>Dr. Carl Reinhardt</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The codex contains Coptic translations of three major early Christian Gnostic works:
        <em>The Gospel of Mary</em>, <em>The Apocryphon of John</em>, and <em>The Sophia of Jesus Christ</em> — 
        all originally composed in Greek during the second century.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though partially lost (pages 1–6 and 11–14 are missing), the surviving text preserves Mary’s 
        visionary dialogue with the risen Christ, revealing the soul’s ascent through the powers and 
        her confrontation with Peter and the disciples.
      </p>

      <p>
        What remains of this text is among the most intimate expressions of early Christian gnosis — 
        where <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong> emerges as the truest disciple, the one who 
        “saw the Lord in a vision” and taught that salvation is an inward journey, not a law.
