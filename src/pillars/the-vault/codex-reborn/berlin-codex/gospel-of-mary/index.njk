      <p>
        The <strong>Gospel of Mary</strong> survives only in fragments, yet it remains one of the most
        profound and intimate Gnostic writings. Preserved within the <strong>Berlin Codex</strong>, it
        presents Mary Magdalene not as follower, but as <em>knower</em> — the disciple who understood
        the teachings that the others feared.
      </p>

      <p>
        It reveals Christ’s secret instruction on the ascent of the soul, the powers that oppose it,
        and the role of inner vision in overcoming fear. This gospel stands as a testimony to the
        authority of the awakened mind and the dignity of the feminine bearer of Gnosis.
      </p>

      <p>
        The text is presented here in its restored form, formatted for clarity and preserved within
        <strong>Codex Reborn</strong> of <strong>The Vault</strong> so that its light endures.
