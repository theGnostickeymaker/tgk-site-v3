      <p>
        <strong>Codex Reborn</strong> forms part of <strong>The Vault</strong> â€” the archival pillar of 
        <em>The Gnostic Key</em> â€” where sacred, forbidden, and forgotten texts are preserved for 
        study and remembrance. It gathers the <strong>Gnostic Gospels</strong> recovered from 
        Nag Hammadi and other ancient libraries, curated for modern seekers of gnosis.
      </p>

      <p>
        These scrolls, once buried in sand or condemned by empire, are restored within the 
        <strong>Vault of Remembrance</strong>. Each text reveals fragments of a celestial map â€” 
        Sophiaâ€™s descent, the false creator, and the awakening of the soulâ€™s divine spark.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Codex Reborn collection is organised into five sub-libraries: the 
        <em>Nag Hammadi Library</em>, the <em>Berlin Codex</em>, the <em>Codex Tchacos</em>, 
        <em>Biblical & Apocryphal Texts</em>, and <em>Independent Texts</em>. 
        Each section offers curated scrolls linked across <strong>The Teachings</strong> and 
        <strong>The Gnostic Eye</strong>, forming a unified library of remembrance.
