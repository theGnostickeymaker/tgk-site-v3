      <p>
        The <strong>Berlin Codex</strong> is one of the most important Gnostic manuscripts to survive antiquity.
        Preserved in Egypt, it contains revelatory dialogues attributed to <em>Mary Magdalene</em>,
        <em>John</em>, and <em>Sophia</em>, capturing the voice of the awakened soul in conversation with the divine.
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of <strong>Codex Reborn</strong> within <strong>The Vault</strong>, this collection offers
        digital restorations of its surviving pages, including the <em>Gospel of Mary Magdalene</em> and
        related fragments. Each manuscript is formatted for clarity and interlinked with
        <strong>The Afterlife Series</strong> and <strong>The Gnostic Eye</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        These writings are more than historical artefacts. They are testimonies of remembrance,
        restoring knowledge once suppressed or condemned. In studying them,
        the seeker participates in rekindling a light that empire sought to extinguish.
