      <p>
        The <strong>Berlin Codex</strong> is one of the most significant Gnostic manuscripts,
        discovered in Egypt and preserved through centuries of silence. It contains
        revelations attributed to <em>Mary Magdalene</em>, <em>John</em>, and <em>Sophia</em>,
        capturing dialogues between the awakened soul and the divine.
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of <strong>Codex Reborn</strong> within <strong>The Vault</strong>, this
        collection offers digital restorations of its surviving pages â€”
        including the <em>Gospel of Mary Magdalene</em> and related fragments â€”
        formatted for clarity and cross-linked with the <strong>Afterlife Series</strong>
        and <strong>The Gnostic Eye</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each preserved text serves as a mirror of remembrance: the soulâ€™s
        testimony against amnesia. In reading, the seeker participates in the
        act of re-illumination â€” reviving the sacred knowledge once condemned
        as heresy, now reborn in light.
