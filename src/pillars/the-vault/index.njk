    <p>
      <strong>The Vault</strong> is the library of The Gnostic Key â€” a pillar devoted to
      preserving forbidden and sacred writings. Here youâ€™ll find codices, scrolls, and
      erased histories: the texts others tried to burn, banish, or forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Gnostic gospels to mystical archives, from forbidden documents to ancient
      transmissions, the Vault safeguards these works so they remain accessible to
      seekers. It is not just an archive â€” it is a sanctuary of memory, where the
      written word survives erasure.
