      <p>
        <strong>The Vault</strong> is the library of <em>The Gnostic Key</em> — a pillar devoted to
        preserving forbidden and sacred writings. Here you’ll find codices, pages, and
        erased histories: the texts others tried to burn, banish, or forget.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Gnostic gospels to mystical archives, from forbidden documents to ancient
        transmissions, the Vault safeguards these works so they remain accessible to
        seekers. It is not just an archive — it is a sanctuary of memory, where the
        written word survives erasure.
