      <p>
        <strong>The Forge</strong> is where TGK becomes an institution, not only a library of episodes.
        It is a home for creators who want serious readers, structured dialogue, and a lasting archive for their work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside The Forge you will find founder work, guest essays, collaborative investigations, and author hubs,
        each designed to support clarity, rigour, and direct connection between writer and reader.
