    <p>
      <strong>The Gnostic Eye</strong> is the pillar of vision and analysis â€” where
      culture, politics, and events are seen not just as history, but as symbols.
      Through archetypal lenses, it reads the signs of the age and the masks of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      From modern idols to ancient archetypes, this pillar reveals the patterns that
      shape our collective story. The Eye is a watcher, a decoder, and a witness to
      the hidden geometry of the world.
