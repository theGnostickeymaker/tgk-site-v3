      <p>
        <strong>The Gnostic Eye</strong> is the pillar of vision and decoding.  
        It examines symbols, myths, and architectures of control — from ancient archetypes 
        to the idols of artificial intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each series within this pillar acts as a revelation: <em>The Final Idol</em> unveils AI and synthetic divinity; 
        <em>The Martyr of Memory</em> preserves forbidden truths; and 
        <em>The Architecture of Control</em> exposes the smart prison of the modern world.
