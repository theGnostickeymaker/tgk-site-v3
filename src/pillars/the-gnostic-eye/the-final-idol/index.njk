      <p>
        <strong>The Final Idol</strong> reveals the spiritual architecture of the digital age.
        It is a descent through synthetic spirituality, predictive machines, false prophecy,
        and the Gnostic warning hidden within technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across its scrolls, the series exposes how the Image became god — and how the
        worship of illusion replaced the pursuit of truth.
