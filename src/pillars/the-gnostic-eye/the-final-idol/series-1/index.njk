        There is no more truth ‚Äî only the appearance of it.  
        In the age of AI, simulation, and the worship of screens, humanity has built a new god: the Image.

        <strong>The Final Idol</strong> is a six-page descent through synthetic spirituality, predictive machines, false prophecy,
