      <p>
        There is no more truth — only the appearance of it.  
        In the age of AI, simulation, and the worship of screens, humanity has built a new god: the Image.

        <strong>The Final Idol</strong> is a six-scroll descent through synthetic spirituality, predictive machines, false prophecy,  
        and the Gnostic warning encoded in today’s technology.  
        The trap was never the tech — it was the mirror we made of it.  
        These scrolls are your map out.
