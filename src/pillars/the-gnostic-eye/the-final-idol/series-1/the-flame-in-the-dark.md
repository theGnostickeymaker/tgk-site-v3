  promptTitle: "The Flame That Survives"
  intro: "Where in your life do you feel the flicker — the part of you that refuses to conform? This prompt invites reflection on the soul’s unencoded spark."
  question: "What would it mean to protect that spark in a world trying to digitize your spirit?"
  points:
    - "Where do you sense the fire that the Machine cannot reach?"
    - "How do you keep your truth alive in a world of copies?"
    - "When conformity feels safe, how do you choose flame over comfort?"
  footer: "Join the reflection via <strong>#TheGnosticKey</strong> and tag <strong>@thegnostickey</strong> to share your insight."
