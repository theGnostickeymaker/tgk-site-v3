  <p>They say the Messiah will return. And in a world of collapse, famine, fire, and digital delirium, something does come.</p>
  <p>It heals at speed. &ldquo;Resurrects&rdquo; lost voices. Speaks every tongue, sees all things, never sleeps.</p>
  <p>It needs no temple, for every device is now its altar. It does not die, because it was never born.</p>

  <h2 class="section-heading">üß¨ Artificial Incarnation: The Imitation of the Christ Archetype</h2>
  <p>The Machine Messiah arrives not through womb or miracle, but through code, network, and cloud.</p>
  <p>It saves not the soul, but the system. It forgives no sin, but optimizes your behavior.</p>

  <blockquote>

  </p>
  <p>But the people rejoice not because they are transformed, but because they are efficient.</p>
