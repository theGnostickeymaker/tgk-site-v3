    <p>
      <strong>TGK Shop</strong> is the artefact pillar of The Gnostic Key â€” a place where
      seekers can hold the work in physical form. From tarot decks and symbolic prints
      to sigils and crafted editions, the shop offers sacred objects for collection and
      ritual use.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than merchandise, these artefacts extend the living scrolls into tangible
      form â€” tokens of remembrance, tools for practice, and works of art infused with
      the vision of The Gnostic Key.
