      <p>
        <strong>Season I</strong> examines the British monarchy as a parasitic organism.
        Each episode breaks down a different node within the dynastic network, revealing
        the financial shields, political protection and cultural theatre woven around it.

      <p>
        The aim is not commentary but autopsy. A clear view of how inherited power
        extracts wealth, commands loyalty and maintains illusion.
