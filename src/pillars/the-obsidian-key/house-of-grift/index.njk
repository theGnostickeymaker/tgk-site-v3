      <p>
        <strong>House of Grift</strong> is the first major investigation within
        The Obsidian Key. It dismantles the mythology of royal service,
        revealing the extraction networks, financial shields and public theatre
        that preserve inherited power.
      </p>

      <p>
        From dynastic privilege and sealed fortunes to the mystique of divine
        right and modern public relations alchemy, each episode examines how
        wealth is channelled upwards while the public is offered narrative,
        ceremony and illusion.
