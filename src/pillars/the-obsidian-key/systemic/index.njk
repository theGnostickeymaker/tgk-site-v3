      A domestic map of the UK control stack: how crisis language becomes law, how law becomes procedure,

      </summary>

      <p>
        <strong>SYSTEMIC</strong> is an Obsidian Key investigation into how UK institutions erode civil liberties
        through legal layering, discretionary enforcement, and crisis-driven consent.
      </p>

      <p>
        This series is UK-focused and mechanism-first: Acts, policies, court practice, policing culture, surveillance,
        and the administrative pressures that reshape what a person can say, do, and refuse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Global geopolitics and war architecture belong to <strong>Empire Codes</strong>. SYSTEMIC tracks what happens
        when the machine turns inward.
