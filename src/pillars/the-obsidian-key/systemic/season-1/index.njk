      Season I establishes the SYSTEMIC baseline: the legal staircase that narrowed civil liberties, the narrative machinery
      that converts uncertainty into guilt, and the courtroom procedures that make coercion feel routine.

        <strong>Season I: Diagnosing Injustice</strong> is the entry point to SYSTEMIC. It maps the UK control stack in its most

        simpler: how does a state turn rights into permissions without declaring a coup?
