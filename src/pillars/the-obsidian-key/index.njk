    <p>
      <strong>The Obsidian Key</strong> is the investigative pillar of The Gnostic Key â€”
      a place for deep dives into systems of control, societal erosion, and the hidden
      architecture of power. Here the scrolls unravel the illusions that mask injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the <em>House of Grift</em> to <em>SYSTEMIC</em>, these investigations map
      corruption, expose courtroom alchemy, and confront the shadow structures that
      shape our world. The Obsidian Key is not just research â€” it is a lens, sharpened
      to cut through the myths and reveal what lies beneath.
