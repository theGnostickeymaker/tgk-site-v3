      <p>
        <strong>The Obsidian Key</strong> is the investigative pillar of The Gnostic Key.
        It examines the structures beneath public illusion, exposing the covert mechanisms 
        of power, wealth extraction, and institutional theatre that shape the modern world.

        From the parasitic dynasties of the <em>House of Grift</em> to the judicial rituals
        of <em>SYSTEMIC</em> and the financial spellcraft explored in <em>Empire Codes</em>,
        these pages illuminate the architecture designed to manage populations, consolidate
        wealth, and maintain inherited authority.
