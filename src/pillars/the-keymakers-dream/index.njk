    <p>
      <strong>The Keymakerâ€™s Dream</strong> is the memoir pillar of The Gnostic Key â€”
      a record of lived gnosis, where memory itself becomes myth. Here are scrolls that
      trace encounters with archetypes, guardians of memory, and the hidden figures who
      haunt the inner world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blending personal narrative with symbolic vision, this pillar opens a window into
      the life behind the lock: the story of a seeker whose dream is also a map, whose
      myth is also a memory.
