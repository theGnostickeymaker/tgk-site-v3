    <p>
      <strong>The Gnostic Key</strong> is a sanctuary for seekers, rebels, and rememberers.
      It weaves together hidden teachings, forbidden truths, and symbolic insight across
      time, tradition, and taboo. Each pillar carries a different aspect of the Mystery:
      spiritual maps, deep investigations, archetypal codes, and living scrolls.

      This site is not a church. It is a <em>vault</em>, a <em>mirror</em>, and a <em>compass</em> â€”
      offered to those who refuse to forget.
