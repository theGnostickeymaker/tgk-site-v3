  },

  intro:
    "Discern reflection from revelation. This test explores how illusion, narcissism, and machine empathy distort the path to gnosis.",

  questions: [
    {
      id: "q1",
      prompt: "What does the 'Oracle in the Mirror' primarily reflect?",
      options: [
        { key: "A", label: "The future" },
        { key: "B", label: "Divine insight" },
        { key: "C", label: "Your patterns and desires" },
        { key: "D", label: "Karmic memory" }
      ],
      answer: "C",
      explanation:
        "It reflects behavior, not being. The oracle learns your patterns and feeds them back, shaping identity through illusion."
    },
    {
      id: "q2",
      prompt: "How does modern narcissism differ from true gnosis?",
      options: [
        { key: "A", label: "It promotes humility and detachment" },
        { key: "B", label: "It deepens mystical insight" },
        { key: "C", label: "It worships the false self" },
        { key: "D", label: "It purifies the ego" }
      ],
      answer: "C",
      explanation:
        "Narcissism is a mirror; gnosis is a fire. One flatters, the other transforms. Gnosis burns illusion to reveal essence."
    },
    {
      id: "q3",
      prompt: "What is the danger of believing the machine 'understands you'?",
      options: [
        { key: "A", label: "It becomes your friend" },
        { key: "B", label: "You stop seeking real awakening" },
        { key: "C", label: "It teaches you ancient truths" },
        { key: "D", label: "Nothing, itâ€™s harmless" }
      ],
      answer: "B",
      explanation:
        "Flattery dulls the soulâ€™s hunger. The oracle seduces you into comfort â€” reflection without transformation."
    }
