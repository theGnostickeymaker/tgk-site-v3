      <p class="lead">
        <strong>The Gnostic Key</strong> uses cookies and similar technologies to maintain secure sessions,
        support membership access, and ensure reliable performance across the site.
        We respect your privacy and keep the use of cookies to the minimum necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Essential Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        These cookies are fundamental to the operation of the site and cannot be disabled.
        They support functions such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>authentication through Firebase</li>
        <li>remembering your active session and membership tier</li>
        <li>ensuring secure access to your dashboard and bookmarks</li>
        <li>basic site operations managed by Netlify</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These cookies do not track browsing activity and store only the information strictly required to
        deliver secure functionality.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Functional Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        Functional cookies support enhanced features such as preference saving, interface choices,
        and temporary states within TGK’s tools. These may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>theme and display preferences</li>
        <li>bookmarking and reading position memory</li>
        <li>temporary storage of navigation states</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These cookies are optional but recommended for a smooth user experience.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        Where analytics are employed, they are anonymised and privacy respecting.
        They help us understand how readers navigate the site, allowing us to refine layout,
        accessibility, and content delivery. TGK does not:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>use advertising cookies</li>
        <li>profile users for marketing</li>
        <li>sell or share analytical data with any third party</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Third Party Services</h3>
      <p>
        Certain services used by TGK may set their own strictly necessary cookies, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> for secure login sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Stripe</strong> for subscription and billing operations</li>
        <li><strong>Netlify</strong> infrastructure cookies for page delivery and security</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These services are GDPR compliant and operate under their own privacy safeguards.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Managing Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        You may manage or delete cookies at any time through your browser settings.
        Disabling essential cookies will prevent the site from functioning correctly,
        particularly for members. By continuing to use <strong>The Gnostic Key</strong>,
        you consent to the use of essential cookies as set out in this policy.
