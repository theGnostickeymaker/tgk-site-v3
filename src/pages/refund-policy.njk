        We aim to maintain fairness and clarity for every seeker.  
        Below youâ€™ll find how refunds, cancellations, and failed payments are handled at <strong>The Gnostic Key</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Subscription Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        All TGK memberships are processed securely through <strong>Stripe</strong>.
        You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account dashboard.
        Refunds are available within <strong>14 days</strong> of the initial purchase
        for annual or lifetime plans.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Cancellations</h3>
      <p>
        Monthly subscriptions can be cancelled anytime and will remain active until the
        end of the current paid period. No further charges will be applied after cancellation.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Failed Payments</h3>
      <p>
        If a payment fails, your account automatically reverts to the
        <em>Free</em> tier until the issue is resolved.
        Once payment is successful, access to your original tier is restored instantly.
      </p>
