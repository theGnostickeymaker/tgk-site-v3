      <p class="lead">
        We aim to ensure fairness and clarity for all members.  
        This policy explains how refunds, cancellations, and failed payments are managed at
        <strong>The Gnostic Key</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Subscription Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        All memberships are processed securely through <strong>Stripe</strong>.
        You may cancel at any time through your account dashboard.
        Refunds are available within <strong>14 days</strong> of the initial charge for annual or lifetime plans,
        provided substantial content access has not taken place.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Cancellations</h3>
      <p>
        Monthly subscriptions may be cancelled at any time and will remain active until the end of the
        current paid period.  
        No further charges will be taken once cancellation is confirmed.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Failed Payments</h3>
      <p>
        If a payment fails, your account automatically reverts to the <em>Free</em> tier.
        Once the payment issue is resolved, access to your previous tier is restored immediately
        without additional action on your part.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Contact and Support</h3>
      <p>
        For refund enquiries, billing support, or account adjustments, contact our team at
