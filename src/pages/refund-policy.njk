      <p class="lead">
        We strive to ensure fairness, clarity, and transparency for every seeker.  
        The following outlines how refunds, cancellations, and failed payments are managed at <strong>The Gnostic Key</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Subscription Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        All TGK memberships are processed securely through <strong>Stripe</strong>.
        You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account dashboard.
        Refunds are available within <strong>14 days</strong> of the initial purchase
        for annual or lifetime plans, provided that significant content access has not already occurred.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Cancellations</h3>
      <p>
        Monthly subscriptions may be cancelled at any time and will remain active until the
        end of the current paid period. No further payments will be taken after cancellation.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Failed Payments</h3>
      <p>
        If a payment fails, your account will automatically revert to the
        <em>Free</em> tier until the issue is resolved.
        Once payment is successfully processed, access to your original tier will be restored immediately.
      </p>
