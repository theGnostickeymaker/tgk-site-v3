      <p class="lead muted">
        <strong>The Gnostic Key</strong> is a living digital library, part sacred archive and part social experiment, created to preserve wisdom, expose power, and reawaken collective sovereignty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Founded in the United Kingdom and published by <em>The Gnostic Key Limited</em>, the project unites research, symbolism, investigative journalism, and metaphysical study within one coherent system.
        Each pillar of TGK, from <a href="/pillars/the-teachings/"><strong>The Teachings</strong></a> to <a href="/pillars/the-obsidian-key/"><strong>The Obsidian Key</strong></a>, is designed to illuminate a distinct aspect of truth: spiritual, political, historical, or systemic.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-subheading">Purpose and Vision</h3>
      <p>
        TGK exists to restore depth to public understanding in an age of distraction and deception.
        Its mission is to teach discernment, moral courage, and intellectual independence, the essential qualities of the true seeker.
        Through its episodes, archives, and symbolic systems, TGK seeks to unveil the architecture of control and the hidden laws that shape modern life.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-subheading">Structure and Sovereignty</h3>
      <p>
        The Gnostic Key operates as an independent knowledge commons under <strong>The Gnostic Key Limited</strong>, a UK registered entity committed to transparency, fair use, and public accountability.
        The platform is self funded through reader membership and symbolic commerce, ensuring complete freedom from institutional or corporate influence.
      </p>

      <p>
        All paid content tiers directly support research, preservation, and the creation of new public archives.
        TGK does not sell user data and hosts no advertising or sponsored material.
      </p>

      <!-- Manifesto Section -->
      <!-- ===================== -->

      <h3 class="section-subheading">The Manifesto</h3>

      <p class="lead">
        The Gnostic Key is guided by a formal manifesto that defines its ethical boundaries, philosophical intent, and cultural purpose.
        This manifesto is not a political programme, nor a call to action, but a declaration of principles rooted in education, truth, and intellectual sovereignty.
      </p>

      <p>
        It exists to state clearly what this project stands for, what it rejects, and why it refuses to operate within the assumptions of a failing cultural order.
        Readers seeking a deeper understanding of TGK’s foundations are encouraged to engage with it in full.
      </p>

      <p class="small muted">
        The Gnostic Key Manifesto is a philosophical and educational statement.
        It does not advocate violence, insurrection, or unlawful activity, nor does it instruct readers to evade legal or civic responsibility.
        Its focus is the cultivation of critical thought, historical understanding, and personal sovereignty through knowledge.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="manifesto-extract">
        <p>
          The Gnostic Key is founded upon an uncompromising truth:
          the world as presented to us is an illusion,
          the world as experienced by us is a system,
          and every system can be understood, resisted, and rebuilt.
        </p>

        <p>
          We reject narratives designed to keep ordinary people obedient, divided, or self-doubting.
          We believe that class is the true axis of power, and that knowledge is the only path to sovereignty.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Gnostic Key is not a brand or an institution.
          It is a counter-system, a parallel school, and a living archive for truths that power seeks to erase.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The full manifesto is published as a standalone declaration and can be read here:
        <a href="/manifesto/"><strong>The Gnostic Key Manifesto</strong></a>.

      <!-- ===================== -->

      <h3 class="section-subheading">The Name and its Symbolism</h3>
      <p>
        The name <em>The Gnostic Key</em> represents the act of remembrance, the unlocking of hidden knowledge long buried beneath fear, empire, and illusion.
        The glyphs that accompany TGK’s identity (☉ 🜂 ☿ ✷) signify illumination, transformation, communication, and harmony, together forming the fourfold alchemy of awakening.
