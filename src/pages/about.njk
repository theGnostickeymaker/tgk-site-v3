    <p class="lead muted">
      <strong>The Gnostic Key</strong> is a living digital library — part sacred archive, part social experiment — created to preserve wisdom, expose power, and reawaken collective sovereignty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Founded in the United Kingdom and published by <em>The Gnostic Key Limited</em>, the project unites research, symbolism, investigative journalism, and metaphysical study into one coherent system.
      Every “pillar” of TGK — from <a href="/pillars/the-teachings/">The Teachings</a> to <a href="/pillars/the-obsidian-key/">The Obsidian Key</a> — is designed to illuminate a different aspect of truth: spiritual, political, historical, or systemic.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subheading">Purpose & Vision</h3>
    <p>
      TGK exists to restore depth to public understanding in an age of distraction and deception.
      Its mission is to teach discernment, moral courage, and intellectual independence — the qualities of a true seeker.  
      Through its scrolls, archives, and symbolic systems, TGK seeks to reveal the architecture of control and the hidden laws that govern modern life.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subheading">Structure & Sovereignty</h3>
    <p>
      The Gnostic Key operates as an independent knowledge commons under <strong>The Gnostic Key Limited</strong>, a UK-registered entity committed to transparency, fair use, and public accountability.
      The platform is self-funded through reader membership and symbolic commerce, ensuring freedom from institutional or corporate influence.
    </p>

    <p>
      All paid content tiers directly support research, preservation, and the creation of new public archives.  
      TGK does not sell user data, nor does it host advertising or sponsored narratives.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subheading">The Name & Symbolism</h3>
    <p>
      The name <em>“The Gnostic Key”</em> symbolises the act of remembering — of unlocking hidden knowledge long buried beneath fear, empire, and illusion.
      The glyphs that accompany TGK’s identity (☉ 🜂 ☿ ✷) represent illumination, transformation, communication, and harmony — the fourfold alchemy of awakening.
